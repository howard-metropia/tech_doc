## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this as a **super-smart travel assistant** that knows every way to get around a city. When you say "get me from point A to point B," it considers buses, trains, walking, biking, driving, ride-sharing, and even combinations like "drive to a park-and-ride lot, then take the train." It's like having a local transportation expert who knows real-time conditions, bike-share locations, and optimal connections.

**Technical explanation:** 
A sophisticated intermodal transportation planning controller that integrates multiple routing engines, real-time data sources, and mobility services. It orchestrates calls to internal routing engines for Houston/Taiwan and falls back to HERE API for other regions, while incorporating shared mobility options, real-time transit data, fare information, and geospatial processing.

**Business value explanation:**
Core functionality for comprehensive mobility-as-a-service platforms, enabling seamless multimodal transportation that reduces car dependency, optimizes travel efficiency, and integrates various transportation options into unified user experiences.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Performance Optimization
- **Caching Strategy:** Route caching for frequently requested origin-destination pairs
- **Parallel Processing:** Concurrent API calls to multiple services
- **Fallback Handling:** Graceful degradation when primary engines fail
- **Rate Limiting:** Built-in API call limiting to prevent quota exhaustion

### Geographic Boundaries
```javascript
// Houston Area (Lat/Lng boundaries)
houston: {
  lat: [28.937417, 30.626585],
  lng: [-96.336375, -94.221907]
}

// Taiwan Area  
taiwan: {
  lat: [21.88, 25.32],
  lng: [118, 122]
}
```

### Error Handling & Monitoring
- **Slack Integration:** Real-time error notifications to operations teams
- **InfluxDB Metrics:** Performance monitoring and API usage tracking
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to alternative routing when primary services fail

### Real-time Considerations
- **5-minute Window:** Real-time bus data used for departures within ¬±5 minutes
- **Timezone Handling:** Automatic timezone detection and conversion
- **Service Alerts:** Integration with transit agency alert systems

### Integration Complexity
This controller manages one of the most complex integration scenarios in the platform:
- 15+ external API integrations
- Real-time data processing from multiple sources
- Geospatial calculations and route optimization
- Multi-language support (English, Chinese)
- Currency and fare handling across regions
