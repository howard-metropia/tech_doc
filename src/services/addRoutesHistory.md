# Add Routes History Service Documentation

## 🔍 Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This is a simple, single-purpose service responsible for saving a user's calculated routes to their history in the database.

**Keywords:** routes-history | user-history | trip-planning | logging | mongodb

**Primary use cases:** 
- Logging every route that is generated for a user for analytical or historical purposes.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Mongoose.

## 📋 Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as a **personal travel diary**. Every time the app plans a route for you, this service takes a copy of that route and saves it into your diary. This allows the system to keep a record of all the trips you've considered.

**Technical explanation:** 
A JavaScript class `addRoutesHistory` with a single asynchronous method, `add`. This method iterates through a `routes` object (presumably containing different route options like `drive`, `walk`, etc.) and saves each individual route as a new document in the `RoutesHistorys` MongoDB collection. Each document is associated with a `userId`.

**Business value explanation:**
Logging user route searches is crucial for understanding user intent and travel patterns. This data can be analyzed to understand popular origins and destinations, preferred modes of transport, and times of day for travel. This insight is invaluable for improving the routing engine, planning new features, and for transportation planners to understand mobility demand.

## 🔧 Technical Specifications

- **File:** `allrepo/connectsmart/tsp-api/src/services/addRoutesHistory.js`
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES2020)
- **Type:** Database Service
- **File Size:** < 1 KB
- **Complexity Score:** ⭐ (Very Low - A simple loop and database save operation.)

**Dependencies (Criticality Level):**
- `@app/src/models/RoutesHistorys`: The Mongoose model for the `routes_historys` MongoDB collection (**Critical**).

## 📝 Detailed Code Analysis

### `add(data, userId)`
- **Purpose**: To save one or more routes to a user's history.
- **Logic**:
    1. The method receives a `data` object, which is expected to have a `routes` property.
    2. It loops through each key in `data.routes`.
    3. Inside the loop, for each route object (`tempRoutes`), it creates a new instance of the `RoutesHistorys` Mongoose model.
    4. The new model instance is populated with the `userId` and the `tempRoutes` object (wrapped in an array).
    5. It calls `await mogone.save()` to persist the new document to the MongoDB database.

**Note:** The name `mogone` is likely a typo and was intended to be `mongone` or `mongoOne`. The commented-out code snippets suggest this file was used for testing find and remove operations as well.

## 🚀 Usage Methods

```javascript
// Example of how another service (e.g., a routing service) would use this
const addRoutesHistoryService = require('@app/src/services/addRoutesHistory');

async function planRoute(userId, origin, destination) {
  // ... logic to call HERE/Google API and get route options ...
  const calculatedRoutes = {
    drive: { polyline: '...', duration: 1200 },
    transit: { polyline: '...', duration: 2400 }
  };

  // After calculating, save the routes to the user's history
  await addRoutesHistoryService.add({ routes: calculatedRoutes }, userId);

  // Return the routes to the user
  return calculatedRoutes;
}
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Inefficient Loop**: The current implementation creates and saves a new document for *each* route within the `routes` object. If a user is shown 3 different route options, this will create 3 separate documents in the database. It might be more efficient to store all routes for a single search in one document. For example: `new RoutesHistorys({ user_id: userId, routes: data.routes })`.
- **Typo**: The variable `mogone` is likely a typo.
