# Migration Documentation: 20231106144900_MET-13357.js

## üìã Migration Overview
- **Purpose:** Create tow and go count view for analytics and reporting on towing events
- **Date:** 2023-11-06 14:49:00
- **Ticket:** MET-13357
- **Risk Level:** Low

## üîß Schema Changes
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW tow_and_go_count AS 
SELECT call_third_backId AS tow_id, tow_and_go.created_on, event_lat AS lat, 
       event_lng AS lng, event_type AS tow_reason_id 
FROM hybrid.tow_and_go 
LEFT JOIN hybrid.auth_user ON tow_and_go.user_id = auth_user.id 
WHERE call_third_backId NOT IN (-1, 0) AND is_debug != 1;
```

## üìù Changes Summary
| Operation | Table/Collection | Field/Index | Description |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| CREATE VIEW | tow_and_go_count | - | Analytics view for towing events |
| FILTER | tow_and_go_count | call_third_backId | Excludes invalid tow IDs (-1, 0) |
| FILTER | tow_and_go_count | is_debug | Excludes debug users from analytics |

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Up Migration
- Creates view for tow and go event analytics
- Joins towing events with user authentication data
- Filters out debug users and invalid tow IDs
- Provides clean dataset for reporting and analysis

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Down Migration
- Drops tow_and_go_count view
- All view-based analytics access will be lost

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Critical for towing service analytics and reporting
- Excludes test/debug data for accurate metrics
- Links towing events to user data for comprehensive analysis
- Used by admin platform and reporting systems
