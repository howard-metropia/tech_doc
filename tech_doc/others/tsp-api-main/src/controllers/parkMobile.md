## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this as a **digital parking meter on your phone**. Instead of walking to a physical parking meter and feeding coins, this controller lets you pay for parking through your mobile app. You can check how much parking costs in different areas, start your parking session digitally, set reminders so you don't get a ticket, and see all your active parking sessions in one place.

**Technical explanation:** 
A Koa.js REST controller that integrates with ParkMobile's parking services API, providing rate lookup, session management, and reminder functionality. It handles zone-based pricing, payment processing, and parking event lifecycle management through standardized REST endpoints.

**Business value explanation:**
Enables seamless integration of parking payments into the broader mobility platform, reducing friction in urban transportation by allowing users to handle parking as part of their trip planning and payment workflow.

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Available Endpoints

#### Get Rate Zone (`GET /pm_rate_zone`)
Retrieves parking zone information and available rates for a specific zone.

#### Get Rate Price (`GET /pm_rate_price`)
Calculates parking costs based on zone, time blocks, and duration.

#### Start Parking (`POST /pm_parking`)
Initiates a parking session with payment processing and license plate registration.

#### Set Parking Reminder (`PUT /pm_parking`)
Configures reminder alerts for active parking sessions to prevent ticket violations.

#### List Parking Events (`GET /pm_parking`)
Retrieves user's current active parking sessions and history.

### Service Integration
All endpoints delegate to the ParkMobile service layer:
- **Input Validation:** `checkInputParams()` for schema validation
- **Rate Services:** `getRateZone()`, `getRatePrice()` for pricing information
- **Session Management:** `startParking()` for payment and session creation
- **Reminder System:** `setParkingReminder()` for notification management
- **Event Tracking:** `listOnGoingParkingEvents()` for session status
