## 📋 Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
This service acts like a digital detective that verifies if transportation trips actually happened as reported. Think of it as a GPS-based lie detector for travel - it compares where someone said they went (planned route) with where their phone's GPS says they actually went (trajectory data). Like how a fitness tracker validates your running route, this validates various transportation modes from walking to carpooling.

**Technical explanation:**
A comprehensive trip validation engine that analyzes GPS trajectory data against planned routes using geospatial algorithms, speed profiling, and behavioral pattern matching. Implements mode-specific validation logic with configurable scoring systems and multi-dimensional analysis including route adherence, behavioral compliance, and trip completion metrics.

**Business value:** Ensures integrity of mobility incentive programs, prevents fraud in rideshare applications, and provides compliance verification for corporate transportation policies. Critical for MaaS platforms requiring verified trip data for billing, incentives, and regulatory reporting.

**System context:** Central validation component in the TSP (Transportation Service Provider) API, integrating with trip management, user tracking, and incentive calculation systems within the ConnectSmart mobility platform ecosystem.

## 🚀 Usage Methods

**Basic Usage:**
```javascript
const { validateTrip } = require('./validationLogic');

const result = await validateTrip(trip, trajectoryData, routeData);
// Returns: { passed: boolean, score: number, details: object }
```

**Parameter Configuration:**
```javascript
// Trip object structure
const trip = {
  id: 'trip_123',
  travel_mode: 1, // WALKING, DRIVING, BIKING, etc.
  user_id: 'user_456',
  started_on: '2024-01-01T10:00:00Z',
  ended_on: '2024-01-01T11:00:00Z'
};

// Trajectory data array
const trajectoryData = [{
  timestamp: 1704110400000,
  latitude: 37.7749,
  longitude: -122.4194,
  speed: 5.2, // mph

```javascript
// Direct mode validation
const walkingResult = await validateWalking(trip, trajectoryData, routeData);
const carpoolResult = await validateCarpool(trip, trajectoryData, routeData);
```

**Custom Threshold Configuration:**
```javascript
// Modify SYSTEM_VARIABLES for custom validation rules
SYSTEM_VARIABLES.WALKING.AVG_SPEED_MAX = 8.0; // Increase max walking speed
SYSTEM_VARIABLES.CARPOOL.PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 75; // Adjust carpool proximity

## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Security Considerations:**
- GPS data validation prevents spoofing attacks through behavior analysis
- No sensitive user data logged in validation results
- Input sanitization for all trajectory and route data

**Performance Optimization:**
- Trajectory sampling for large datasets (>1000 points) to reduce computation time
- Geospatial index optimization for route distance calculations
- Memory management for concurrent validation requests

**Common Issues:**
- **Insufficient GPS Data**: Requires minimum 2 trajectory points
- **Route Mismatch**: Planned route must align with actual GPS trajectory
- **Timestamp Errors**: Trajectory data must be chronologically ordered
- **Speed Calculation**: GPS speed data quality affects validation accuracy

**Troubleshooting Steps:**
1. **Low Scores**: Check GPS data quality and sampling frequency
2. **Route Adherence Failures**: Verify route polyline encoding and coordinate system
3. **Carpool Validation Issues**: Ensure both partner trajectories are available
4. **Performance Issues**: Implement trajectory sampling for large datasets
