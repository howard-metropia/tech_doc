# Data Accuracy Slack Warning Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This is a simple, single-purpose utility service designed to send a specific, hardcoded warning message to a Slack channel. Its sole function is to alert the team about a potential data accuracy issue with the "INRIX parking lot available_lots" data feed. It's a "fire-and-forget" type of alert, likely triggered by a separate monitoring job or service.

**Keywords:** slack | alert | warning | monitoring | data-accuracy | inrix | parking

**Primary use cases:** 
- To send a predefined alert to a Slack channel when a data quality issue is detected in the INRIX parking data.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Axios.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What does this service do?** ‚Üí It sends a hardcoded warning message to a Slack channel.
- **Q: What is the warning about?** ‚Üí Specifically about a data accuracy problem with "INRIX parking lot [available_lots]".
- **Q: How does it send the message?** ‚Üí It makes an HTTP POST request to a specific Slack webhook URL defined in the configuration.
- **Q: Who calls this service?** ‚Üí It's not called by a user-facing API. It is almost certainly called by an automated background job or another service that is responsible for monitoring the health of parking data feeds.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as a **specialized red warning light on a factory floor**.
- There's only one light, and it's connected to a single sensor on one specific machine (the INRIX parking data feed).
- The light's label reads: "Warning: Problem with the INRIX parking counter."
- When the sensor detects a problem, it tells this service to turn the light on. The service's only job is to flip that one switch. It doesn't know what the problem is in detail; it just knows it needs to flash its specific warning. This immediately tells the factory floor manager (the dev team) exactly where to go to investigate the problem.

**Technical explanation:** 
The service exports a single async function, `sendSlackWarning`. This function retrieves the current deployment stage from `process.env.PROJECT_STAGE`. It then uses `axios` to make an HTTP POST request to a Slack webhook URL retrieved from `config.parkingDataAccuracyWarningUrl`. The body of the POST request is a JSON object containing a hardcoded `text` field, which includes the stage and a static message: `[Data Accuracy Warning][${stage}] : INRIX parking lot [available_lots] `. The `axios` call is not awaited; instead, it uses `.then()` and `.catch()`, making it a non-blocking, fire-and-forget operation. If the POST request fails, the error is caught, and a warning is logged via `@maas/core/log`.

**Business value explanation:**
Maintaining high data quality from third-party vendors like INRIX is crucial for user trust and application reliability. This service provides a simple but effective mechanism for real-time monitoring and alerting. By immediately notifying the appropriate team channel in Slack when a data accuracy issue is detected, it enables a rapid response to fix data quality problems, minimizing the impact on end-users who rely on that data (e.g., for finding available parking).

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Fire-and-Forget Pattern
The use of `.then().catch()` without returning the promise or using `await` means the function that calls `sendSlackWarning` will not wait for the Slack message to be sent. The call will return immediately, and the HTTP request will happen in the background. This is an appropriate pattern for non-critical alerts where the main program flow should not be blocked by the success or failure of the notification.

### Hardcoded Message
The warning message text is hardcoded directly in the function. This makes the service highly specialized. While this is fine for a single-purpose utility, if more types of data accuracy warnings were needed, this service would need to be refactored to accept the message text as a parameter to make it more reusable.

### Configuration-Driven URL
The Slack webhook URL is correctly sourced from the `config` library (`config.parkingDataAccuracyWarningUrl`). This is a good practice, as it allows the target Slack channel to be changed based on the environment (e.g., a 'dev-alerts' channel for the development stage and a 'prod-alerts' channel for production) without any code changes.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
// This service would be called from within another service or job
// that monitors data quality.

const dataAccuracyChecker = require('./dataAccuracyChecker'); // A hypothetical service
const dataAccuracySlackWarning = require('@app/src/services/dataAccuracySlackWarning');

async function checkInrixParkingData() {
    const isDataAccurate = await dataAccuracyChecker.verifyInrixParking();

    if (!isDataAccurate) {
        // The data is bad. Fire off a warning to Slack.
        // We don't need to wait for the result.
        console.log('INRIX parking data is inaccurate. Sending Slack warning...');
        dataAccuracySlackWarning.sendSlackWarning();
    }
}

// This checkInrixParkingData function would be scheduled to run periodically.
```
