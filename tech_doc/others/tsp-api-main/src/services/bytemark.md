# Bytemark Account API Client Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This service is a lightweight client for the Bytemark Account API. Its sole purpose is to manage the user account lifecycle. It provides simple wrapper functions for creating a new Bytemark account, logging a user in, handling password resets, and deactivating an account. Unlike the more complex `bytemarkCache.js` service (which handles tickets), this service focuses exclusively on user authentication and account management.

**Keywords:** bytemark | account | authentication | login | password-reset | api-client | user-lifecycle

**Primary use cases:** 
- Creating a new user account in the Bytemark system.
- Authenticating a user and retrieving their session data.
- Managing the "forgot password" flow.
- Deactivating a user's Bytemark account.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Axios.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What is this service for?** ‚Üí It talks to the Bytemark service to handle user accounts (create, login, delete, etc.).
- **Q: How is this different from `bytemarkCache.js`?** ‚Üí This service manages **accounts**. `bytemarkCache.js` manages **tickets** for users who are already logged in. This one is for the front door; the other is for inside the house.
- **Q: Is this a good implementation?** ‚Üí It's functional, but has flaws. There are two `userLogin` functions, and only the second one is actually used. The error handling is also very basic.
- **Q: How does it authenticate with Bytemark?** ‚Üí For most actions, it uses a system-wide `Client ID` to identify the application. To deactivate an account, it uses the specific user's `Bearer token`.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as the **front desk clerk at the Bytemark hotel**.
- **`createAccount` (New Guest Registration):** A new guest arrives. The clerk takes their name and email to create a new profile in the hotel's system.
- **`userLogin` (Guest Sign-In):** A returning guest provides their email and password. The clerk checks their credentials and gives them their room key and profile information.
- **`resetPasswordRequest` / `resetPassword` (Lost Key):** A guest forgets their password. The clerk initiates the process to send them a secure link to create a new one. The guest then uses that link to set their new password.
- **`deactivateAccount` (Checking Out Permanently):** A guest wants to delete their profile. The clerk uses the guest's own key (auth token) to verify their identity and then deletes their record from the system.

**Technical explanation:** 
This service is a collection of async functions that wrap `axios` calls to the Bytemark Account API endpoints. A global `axios` client is created with a default timeout and headers. Each function maps to a specific Bytemark API endpoint (e.g., `createAccount` maps to `POST /users`, `userLogin` maps to `POST /users/login`). Authentication with Bytemark is handled by dynamically setting the `Authorization` header, either with a `Client client_id` for application-level requests or a `Bearer` token for user-specific actions. The error handling is minimal: it inspects the `response.data.errors` array from Bytemark and throws the first error object if the array is not empty, which could lead to loss of information if multiple errors are returned. A duplicated `userLogin` function exists, with the second implementation shadowing the first and being the one that is actually exported.

**Business value explanation:**
This service is a foundational component for integrating Bytemark's identity system into the application. It provides the essential building blocks for user registration, login, and account management, which are prerequisites for any user-facing ticketing functionality. By abstracting the direct API calls, it simplifies the process of interacting with the Bytemark identity platform for other parts of the application.

## üîß Technical Specifications

- **File:** `allrepo/connectsmart/tsp-api/src/services/bytemark.js`
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES2017+)
- **Key Libraries:** `axios`, `config`
- **Type:** API Client / Wrapper Service
- **File Size:** ~3 KB
- **Complexity Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium. The logic is simple, but the code quality issues like the duplicated function add unnecessary complexity.)

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Duplicated `userLogin` Function
A significant issue in this file is the presence of two `async function userLogin(...)` definitions. In JavaScript, the second function definition overwrites the first. Therefore, only the second implementation is ever used. This is likely a leftover from a refactoring attempt and should be cleaned up to avoid confusion. The second implementation is also less efficient as it creates a new `axios` client on every call, and it passes the `client_id` in the request body, which differs from the `Authorization` header approach used by other functions in the file.

### Basic Error Handling
The error handling pattern is `if (response.data.errors.length) throw response.data.errors[0];`. This is problematic for two reasons:
1.  **Information Loss:** If the Bytemark API returns multiple errors in the array, all but the first one are ignored.
2.  **Lack of Context:** It throws the raw error object from the third-party API. A better practice would be to wrap it in a custom error class to provide more context about where the error originated.

### Inconsistent API Call in `resetPassword`
The `resetPassword` function is an outlier. It uses `axios.post` directly instead of the shared `client`, and it constructs a `URLSearchParams` object, indicating it's making a request with a `Content-Type` of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This is inconsistent with the other functions that use `application/json`.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
const bytemark = require('@app/src/services/bytemark');

async function registerAndLogin(email, password, firstName, lastName) {
  try {
    // 1. Create the account
    await bytemark.createAccount(email, password, firstName, lastName);
    console.log('Account created successfully.');

    // 2. Log the user in
    const userData = await bytemark.userLogin(email, password);
    console.log('User logged in. Token:', userData.token);
    
    return userData; // Contains tokens and user info
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Bytemark account operation failed:', error);
    // error might be { code: 'some_error', message: 'Email has already been taken' }
    throw error;
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Code Quality:** The file contains a duplicated `userLogin` function that should be resolved to avoid confusion and bugs.
- **Error Handling:** The error handling is minimal and could lead to lost information. It should be made more robust.
- **Inconsistent Practices:** The methods for making API calls are not consistent across all functions (e.g., `resetPassword`).
