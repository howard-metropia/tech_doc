# Calendar Events Sync Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This service provides the backend logic for creating, updating, deleting, and, most importantly, synchronizing a user's calendar events with the application's database. It's designed to mirror the state of a user's external calendar (e.g., from their phone) in the app's MongoDB. Its key feature is a batch `create` operation that efficiently handles insertions, updates, and "soft" deletions (marking as removed) in a single transaction, ensuring the app's event data stays in sync with the user's source calendar.

**Keywords:** calendar | events | sync | crud | mongodb | upsert | soft-delete

**Primary use cases:** 
- Synchronizing a list of calendar events from a user's device to the server.
- Providing standard CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) operations for individual calendar events.
- Ensuring that events deleted on the user's device are marked as "removed" on the server.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Mongoose.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What is this service for?** ‚Üí It manages a copy of a user's calendar events in our database.
- **Q: What is the most important function?** ‚Üí `create`. It's not just for creating; it's a full synchronization function. It updates existing events, creates new ones, and removes old ones all at once.
- **Q: Does it delete events permanently?** ‚Üí No, it performs a "soft delete" by setting an `is_removed` flag to `true`. This preserves the data for historical purposes.
- **Q: What does "upsert" mean?** ‚Üí It's a database operation that means "update if it exists, insert if it doesn't." This service uses it in the `create` function to efficiently handle both new and existing events without needing to check first.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Imagine you have a personal calendar on your phone, and our app wants to display those events. This service acts as the **personal assistant who keeps the app's copy of your calendar perfectly in sync with your phone's calendar**.
- **`create` (The Full Sync):** You show your calendar to the assistant. They go through it line by line.
    - If they see a new event, they add it to the app's copy.
    - If they see an event that has changed (e.g., the time was updated), they update the app's copy.
    - After reviewing all the events you showed them, they look at the app's copy. If they find an event in the app's copy that *wasn't* on the calendar you just showed them, they know you must have deleted it. Instead of erasing it completely, they take a red pen and cross it out (they set `is_removed: true`).
    - At the end, they report back how many events they added, updated, and crossed out.
- **`update` (A Quick Change):** You tell the assistant, "Change the time for my 'Dentist' appointment." They find that single event in the app's copy and update it.
- **`delete` (Crossing Something Out):** You tell the assistant, "Cancel my 'Lunch' meeting." They find that event and cross it out with their red pen.

**Technical explanation:** 
This service exposes three methods for managing calendar events stored in a `CalendarEvents` MongoDB collection.
1.  **`create(events, userId)`**: This is a batch synchronization function, not a simple create. It iterates through an array of `event` objects from the client and uses `Model.updateOne` with the `{ upsert: true }` option. This efficiently inserts new events and updates existing ones based on a `{ uuid, userId }` filter. It then builds a list of all non-removed event UUIDs provided by the client. In a second step, it fetches all non-removed events for the user from the database and compares them against the client's list. Any event in the database that is not present in the client's list is marked as `is_removed: true` (a soft delete).
2.  **`update(inputData)`**: A standard single-document update function. It finds an event by `uuid` and `userId` and applies the changes using `$set`. It uses `findOneAndUpdate` to get the updated document back.
3.  **`delete({ uuid, userId })`**: A soft-delete function. It finds a non-removed event and updates it by setting `{ is_removed: true }`. It throws an error if no document was modified, preventing duplicate delete operations.

**Business value explanation:**
This service is crucial for any feature that relies on a user's personal schedule, such as trip planning, reminders, or providing context-aware suggestions. The efficient synchronization logic in the `create` method minimizes the number of API calls required to keep data fresh, leading to a better user experience and reduced server load. The use of soft deletes preserves a historical record of events, which can be valuable for analytics and understanding user behavior over time.

- **Key Libraries:** `moment-timezone`, Mongoose (`@app/src/models/CalendarEvents`)
- **Type:** CRUD & Data Synchronization Service
- **File Size:** ~4 KB
- **Complexity Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium. The individual `update` and `delete` functions are simple, but the synchronization logic in the `create` function is non-trivial and powerful.)

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### The `create` Function's Sync Logic
The design of the `create` function is highly efficient for mobile clients. A device can simply send its entire current list of calendar events to the API, and this single function will intelligently reconcile the server's state with the client's state. It correctly handles three scenarios in one pass:
1.  **New Events:** Handled by the `upsert: true` option.
2.  **Updated Events:** Handled by the `$set` in the `updateOne` call on an existing document.
3.  **Deleted Events:** Handled by the final loop that soft-deletes any server-side events not present in the client-side payload.

This pattern avoids the need for a chatty API where the client would have to call `POST /event` for new events, `PUT /event/:id` for updated ones, and `DELETE /event/:id` for deleted ones.

### Soft Deletes
The use of `is_removed: true` for deletions is a robust design choice. It prevents data loss and allows for potential "undo" functionality. It also means that relationships to the event from other parts of the system don't need to be immediately cleaned up, preventing cascading delete issues. The check `if (!result.modifiedCount)` in the `delete` function is a smart way to provide feedback if the client tries to delete something that doesn't exist or is already deleted.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
const calendarEventsService = require('@app/src/services/calendar-events');
const userId = 123;

// Example of a client sending its full calendar state to the server
async function syncCalendar(allEventsFromDevice) {
  try {
    const syncResult = await calendarEventsService.create(allEventsFromDevice, userId);
    // syncResult will be: { upsertedCount: 2, modifiedCount: 5, removedCount: 1 }
    console.log('Calendar synchronized successfully:', syncResult);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to sync calendar:', error);
  }
}

// Example of updating a single event
async function updateSingleEvent(eventUuid, updateData) {
    try {
        const updatedEvent = await calendarEventsService.update({
            uuid: eventUuid,
            userId: userId,
            ...updateData
        });
        console.log('Event updated:', updatedEvent);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to update event:', error);
    }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Timezones:** The service uses `moment.utc()` to handle and format dates, indicating a reliance on UTC for storing event times, which is a good practice for avoiding timezone-related bugs.
- **Error Handling:** The service uses a custom `MaasError` with a structured `ERROR_CODE`, which makes error handling more predictable for API consumers.
