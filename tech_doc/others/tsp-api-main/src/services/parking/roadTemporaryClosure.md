# Road Temporary Closure Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
The Road Temporary Closure service filters parking lots based on active road closure events using geospatial polygon intersection to prevent parking bookings in temporarily inaccessible areas.

**Keywords:** road closure | temporary closure | parking filter | geospatial | polygon intersection | traffic management | road events | parking availability | spatial filtering

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Filter parking lots during road maintenance or construction
- Remove inaccessible parking from search results during events
- Real-time parking availability updates based on traffic conditions

**Compatibility:** Node.js 14+, Koa.js framework, Turf.js 6.x

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service like a smart traffic coordinator at a mall parking garage. When construction blocks certain roads, the coordinator knows which parking spots become unreachable and removes them from available options, just like how a GPS reroutes you around closed roads.

**Technical explanation:** 
The service implements geospatial point-in-polygon intersection algorithms to filter parking locations based on active temporal road closure events, using Turf.js for geometric calculations and real-time database queries.

**Business value:** Prevents customer frustration by hiding inaccessible parking spots, reduces support calls, and maintains accurate parking availability data during traffic disruptions.

**System context:** Integrates with the parking search service, road event management system, and real-time traffic data to provide dynamic parking availability filtering.

## üîß Technical Specifications

**File Information:**
- **Path:** `/src/services/parking/roadTemporaryClosure.js`
- **Type:** Service utility module
- **Size:** ~3KB
- **Complexity:** Medium (geospatial operations)

**Dependencies:**
- `@turf/turf` 6.x - Critical: Geospatial operations and polygon math
- `moment-timezone` 2.x - High: Time zone handling for event scheduling
- `lodash` 4.x - Medium: Object manipulation utilities
- `@app/src/models/RoadTemporaryClosure` - Critical: Database model for closure events
- `@maas/core/log` - Medium: Structured logging

**System Requirements:**
- Memory: 50-100MB for geospatial calculations
- CPU: Moderate for polygon intersection algorithms
- Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for closure event storage

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

**Main Functions:**

```javascript
// Primary filtering function - returns filtered parking lots
async filterParkingLots(parkingLots: {offStreet: Array, onStreet: Array})
  ‚Üí Promise<{off: Array, on: Array}>

// Geospatial filter - removes points inside closure polygons  
parkingFilter(polygon: TurfPolygon, points: Array)
  ‚Üí Array<FilteredPoints>

// Active events query - retrieves ongoing closures
async getEvents() ‚Üí Promise<Array<ClosureEvent>>
```

**Execution Flow:**
1. Query database for active closure events (10-50ms)
2. For each event, process polygon geometries (5-20ms per polygon)
3. Filter parking points using point-in-polygon algorithm (1-5ms per point)
4. Return filtered results with performance logging

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Linear complexity O(n) where n = parking lots √ó closure polygons
- Memory usage scales with polygon complexity
- Database query optimized with time-based indexing

## üöÄ Usage Methods

**Basic Integration:**
```javascript
const { filterParkingLots } = require('./roadTemporaryClosure');

// Filter parking lots during search
const filteredParking = await filterParkingLots({
  offStreet: [
    { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060, id: 'lot1' },
    { lat: 40.7589, lng: -73.9851, id: 'lot2' }
  ],
  onStreet: [
    { lat: 40.7505, lng: -73.9934, id: 'street1' }
  ]
});
```

**API Integration Pattern:**
```javascript
// In parking search controller
const rawParkingData = await ParkingService.searchLots(criteria);
const availableParking = await filterParkingLots(rawParkingData);
res.json({ parking: availableParking });
```

**Environment Configuration:**
- Development: Real-time filtering enabled
- Production: Cached closure events (5-minute TTL)
- Testing: Mock closure events for consistent results

## üìä Output Examples

**Successful Filtering:**
```json
{
  "off": [
    { "lat": 40.7128, "lng": -74.0060, "id": "lot1", "available": true }
  ],
  "on": [
    { "lat": 40.7505, "lng": -73.9934, "id": "street1", "spaces": 12 }
  ]
}
```

**Performance Metrics:**
```
[RTC] Ongoing events: 3
[RTC] filtering duration: 15.42 ms
[RTC] total OFFs: 150, remains: 142; total ONs: 89, remains: 85
```

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
// Service fails gracefully, returns original data
{
  "off": [...], // Original unfiltered data
  "on": [...],  // Original unfiltered data
  "warning": "Road closure filtering temporarily unavailable"
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Security Considerations:**
- Input validation prevents polygon injection attacks
- Database queries use parameterized statements
- No sensitive location data exposed in logs

**Performance Gotchas:**
- Large polygons (>1000 vertices) significantly impact performance
- Consider caching filtered results for 1-5 minutes
- Monitor memory usage with complex geometries

**Troubleshooting:**
- **Symptom:** Slow filtering ‚Üí **Solution:** Check polygon complexity, add geometry simplification
- **Symptom:** Missing closures ‚Üí **Solution:** Verify time zone handling in closure events
- **Symptom:** Incorrect filtering ‚Üí **Solution:** Validate polygon coordinate order (counterclockwise)

**Fallback Behavior:**
Service fails gracefully by returning original parking data when errors occur, ensuring parking search remains functional.
