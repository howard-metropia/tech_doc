# Transit Alert Check Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This service is a data enrichment utility that cross-references a user's trip plan with a database of active transit service alerts. Given a trip plan object (likely from a routing engine), it checks each "transit" leg of the journey against a list of current alerts from the `gtfs` database. If a transit leg's route and time overlap with an active alert, it injects a boolean flag (`is_uis_alert: true`) into the trip plan data. This allows the frontend to display a warning to the user about potential disruptions.

**Keywords:** transit-alert | data-enrichment | gtfs | service-disruption | ridemetro | trip-planning

**Primary use cases:** 
- To enhance a user's trip plan with real-time service alert information.
- To check if any bus or train routes in a proposed itinerary are currently affected by delays, detours, or other issues.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Knex.js.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What does this service do?** ‚Üí It takes a trip plan and checks if any of the bus/train routes in it have active service alerts (like "Bus 5 is running 20 minutes late").
- **Q: Where do the alerts come from?** ‚Üí A MySQL database named `gtfs`, specifically from the `ridemetro_transit_alert` table.
- **Q: How does it modify the trip plan?** ‚Üí It doesn't change the route itself. It just adds a flag, `is_uis_alert: true`, to any transit segment that has an alert. The app's user interface would then see this flag and show a warning icon.
- **Q: What's with all the `.replace()` calls?** ‚Üí The route IDs from the trip planner (e.g., "123-ME-1") seem to have extra suffixes compared to the IDs in the alerts database (e.g., "123"). The code is just stripping off these suffixes to make sure the IDs can be matched correctly.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as an **extra-cautious travel assistant reviewing your itinerary right before you leave**.
1.  **Get the Itinerary:** You hand the assistant your trip plan, which might include walking, taking a bus, and then walking again.
2.  **Check the Agency's Bulletin Board:** The assistant first looks at the transit agency's official bulletin board (`gtfs` database) for any new announcements about delays or detours that are currently active.
3.  **Review Each Leg of the Trip:** The assistant looks at your itinerary step-by-step.
    - "First, you walk. No alerts for walking."
    - "Next, you take Bus #54. Let me check..." The assistant scans the bulletin board for any mention of Bus #54. "Ah, yes! It says Bus #54 is on detour today." The assistant takes a red highlighter and marks that part of your itinerary (`is_uis_alert: true`).
    - "Finally, you walk to your destination. All good."
4.  **Hand Back the Marked-Up Itinerary:** The assistant gives you back your itinerary, now with a helpful highlight on the bus portion, so you know there might be a disruption.

**Technical explanation:** 
The service, exported as a singleton instance of the `checkTransitAlert` class, has one method: `checkAlert(data)`. This method first executes a raw SQL query against the `gtfs` database to fetch all alerts from `ridemetro_transit_alert` that have not yet expired. It then iterates through the `routes` and `sections` of the input `data` object. For each section of type `transit`, it normalizes the `route_id` by stripping several common suffixes (e.g., `-ME-1`, `-1`). It then performs a nested loop to compare the normalized route ID and the section's time window against every active alert. If a match is found (i.e., the route ID is the same and their time windows overlap), it injects `section.transport.is_uis_alert = true` and breaks the inner loop. Finally, it returns the entire `data` object, now enriched with the alert flags.

**Business value explanation:**
Providing real-time, relevant service alerts directly within a trip plan is a high-value feature for any transit application. It significantly improves the user experience by proactively warning travelers about potential disruptions, which builds trust and helps them make more informed decisions. This service directly enables that feature, increasing the application's utility and reliability as a travel tool.

## üîß Technical Specifications

- **File:** `allrepo/connectsmart/tsp-api/src/services/checkTransitAlert.js`
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6 Class)
- **Key Libraries:** `knex`, `moment-timezone`
- **Type:** Data Enrichment Service
- **File Size:** ~3 KB
- **Complexity Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium. The logic is a straightforward, if inefficient, series of nested loops. The primary complexity lies in the non-obvious route ID normalization step.)

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Route ID Normalization
The block of `replace()` calls is a brittle but necessary piece of data normalization.
```javascript
let routeID = section.transport.route_id.replace('-ME-1', '');
routeID = routeID.replace('-ME-2', '');
// ... and so on
```
This indicates a data inconsistency between two systems: the routing engine that produces the trip plan and the GTFS database that stores the alerts. While functional, this approach is fragile. If the routing engine starts producing a new suffix (e.g., `-ME-5`), this code would need to be updated to handle it. A more robust solution might involve regular expressions or a more flexible stripping logic.

### Algorithmic Efficiency
The core matching logic uses nested `for...in` loops, which has a time complexity of roughly O(R * S * A), where R is the number of routes in the plan, S is the number of sections per route, and A is the number of active alerts. For a typical trip plan and a reasonable number of alerts, this is perfectly acceptable. However, for very complex trip plans or a system with thousands of active alerts, performance could degrade. A more optimal approach might involve pre-processing the alerts into a `Map` where the key is the `route_id`, allowing for O(1) lookups instead of the innermost loop.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
const checkTransitAlertService = require('@app/src/services/checkTransitAlert');
const routingEngine = require('@app/src/services/hereRouting'); // Example routing engine

async function getTripPlanWithAlerts(origin, destination) {
    // 1. Get the initial trip plan from a routing engine
    let tripPlan = await routingEngine.getTrip(origin, destination);

    // 2. Pass the plan to this service for enrichment
    tripPlan = await checkTransitAlertService.checkAlert(tripPlan);

    // 3. Now the tripPlan object contains the `is_uis_alert` flag
    //    on any affected transit sections.
    // e.g., tripPlan.routes[0].sections[1].transport.is_uis_alert === true
    return tripPlan;
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Data Dependency:** The service's effectiveness is entirely dependent on the quality and timeliness of the data in the `ridemetro_transit_alert` table.
- **Normalization Fragility:** The hardcoded route ID normalization logic is a potential point of failure if upstream data formats change.

## üîó Related File Links
