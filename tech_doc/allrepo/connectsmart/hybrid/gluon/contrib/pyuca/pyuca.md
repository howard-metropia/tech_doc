# PyUCA - Unicode Collation Algorithm Implementation

üîç **Quick Summary (TL;DR)**
- Complete Python implementation of Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) for culturally-correct text sorting and comparison across all languages
- Core functionality: unicode-collation | text-sorting | trie-structure | collation-elements | multilingual-comparison | sort-keys
- Primary use cases: international text sorting, database collation, search ranking, alphabetical ordering in non-Latin scripts
- Compatibility: Python 2/3, requires DUCET allkeys.txt file, MIT licensed, works with any Unicode text

üìã **Functionality Overview**
- **Non-technical explanation:** Like a universal translator for alphabetical order - imagine trying to organize a multilingual library where books in Arabic, Chinese, and Swedish all need to be sorted correctly according to their respective cultural rules. This module implements the international standard for how computers should compare and order text in any language, ensuring "caf√©" comes after "car" and Chinese characters are ordered by stroke count and pronunciation.
- **Technical explanation:** Implements Unicode Technical Standard #10 (UTS #10) for collation, using a trie data structure to efficiently map Unicode sequences to collation elements, then generating multi-level sort keys for culturally-appropriate text comparison and ordering.
- Business value: Enables truly international applications by providing correct text sorting for global users, improving user experience and meeting cultural expectations for data presentation across different markets and languages.
- Context: Core internationalization component used by web frameworks, databases, and applications requiring proper Unicode text handling, particularly important for search, sorting, and data display in multilingual environments.

üîß **Technical Specifications**
- File: `gluon/contrib/pyuca/pyuca.py` (5.1KB, Complexity: Medium-High)
- Dependencies: Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Compatibility: Python 2.7+ and 3.x, Unicode 6.0+ compliance, MIT License
- Configuration: Requires DUCET allkeys.txt file (Default Unicode Collation Element Table)
- System requirements: ~1-2MB RAM for collation table, efficient trie traversal algorithms
- Security: File reading operations, no network access, safe parsing with comment filtering

üìù **Detailed Code Analysis**
- **Node class**: Simple trie node with value and children dictionary for prefix tree structure
- **Trie class**: Prefix tree implementation for efficient Unicode sequence to collation element mapping
  - `add(key, value)`: O(k) insertion where k is key length
  - `find_prefix(key)`: O(k) lookup with longest matching prefix
- **Collator class**: Main UCA implementation with file loading and sort key generation
  - `load(filename)`: Parses DUCET format with comment/metadata filtering
  - `sort_key(string)`: Generates 4-level collation keys for proper text comparison
- Memory pattern: Trie structure optimizes memory usage with shared prefixes
- Performance characteristics: O(n) sort key generation where n is string length
- Implicit weighting: CJK ideographs get calculated weights when not in collation table

üöÄ **Usage Methods**
- Basic text sorting:
```python
from pyuca import Collator
c = Collator("allkeys.txt")
words = ['caf√©', 'car', 'cart', 'na√Øve']
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=c.sort_key)
```
- Custom collation file:
```python
# Subset allkeys.txt for specific languages
c = Collator("custom_collation.txt")
```
- Database integration:
```python
# Sort query results with proper collation
results = sorted(db_results, key=lambda r: c.sort_key(r.name))
```
- Performance optimization:
```python
# Pre-generate sort keys for repeated sorting
items_with_keys = [(c.sort_key(item), item) for item in items]
items_with_keys.sort()
sorted_items = [item for key, item in items_with_keys]
```

üìä **Output Examples**
- Sort key generation:
```python
>>> c = Collator("allkeys.txt")
>>> c.sort_key("caf√©")
(17, 29, 31, 37, 0, 32, 32, 32, 32, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)
>>> c.sort_key("car")
(17, 29, 45, 0, 32, 32, 32, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1)
```
- Multilingual sorting:
```python
# Before UCA (incorrect)
sorted(['M√ºller', 'Mueller', 'M√∂ller']) # ['M√∂ller', 'Mueller', 'M√ºller']
# After UCA (correct German collation)
sorted(['M√ºller', 'Mueller', 'M√∂ller'], key=c.sort_key) # ['M√∂ller', 'M√ºller', 'Mueller']
```
- CJK implicit weighting:
```python
>>> c.sort_key("‰∏≠")  # Chinese character with implicit weight
(64832, 32, 2, 1, 0, 32768, 0, 0, 0)
```
- File loading errors:
```
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'allkeys.txt'
ValueError: Invalid collation element format in line 1234
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- Security: Validate allkeys.txt file integrity to prevent collation table manipulation
- Performance: Initial file loading can take 100-500ms, consider lazy initialization
- Memory usage: Full DUCET table uses ~1-2MB RAM, subset for memory-constrained environments
- Unicode version compatibility: Ensure allkeys.txt matches target Unicode version
- Troubleshooting: Check file encoding (UTF-8) and line ending format for cross-platform compatibility
- CJK handling: Characters not in table get implicit weights based on Unicode code points
- Thread safety: Collator instances are read-only after initialization, safe for concurrent use
