# gluon/contrib/login_methods/x509_auth.py

## Overview

The x509_auth.py module provides X.509 certificate-based authentication for Web2py applications. This method uses digital certificates for user authentication, providing strong cryptographic identity verification commonly used in high-security environments.

## Key Features

- **Certificate-based authentication**: Strong cryptographic identity
- **PKI integration**: Public Key Infrastructure support
- **Client certificates**: User identity through certificates
- **High security**: Government and enterprise grade security

## Configuration

```python
from gluon.contrib.login_methods.x509_auth import x509_auth

auth.settings.login_methods.append(
    x509_auth(
        ca_cert_file='/path/to/ca-certificate.pem',
        verify_chain=True
    )
)
```

## Certificate Requirements

- Valid X.509 client certificates
- Trusted certificate authority (CA)
- Proper certificate chain validation
- Web server SSL/TLS configuration

## Security Features

- Cryptographic identity verification
- Certificate revocation checking
- Chain of trust validation
- Strong authentication assurance

## Use Cases

- Government applications requiring high security
- Financial services with regulatory requirements
- Corporate environments with PKI infrastructure
- High-value transaction systems
