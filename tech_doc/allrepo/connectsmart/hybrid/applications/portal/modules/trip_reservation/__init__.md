**Basic Reservation System Setup:**
```python
# Import trip reservation module
from applications.portal.modules import trip_reservation

# Access core reservation tables
reservation_table = trip_reservation.ReservationTable(db, 'reservation')
trip_table = trip_reservation.TripTable(db, 'trip')
```

```python
# In model files
from applications.portal.modules.trip_reservation import *

# Define all transportation tables
db.define_table('reservation', ReservationTable)
db.define_table('trip', TripTable)
db.define_table('duo_reservation', DuoReservationTable)
db.define_table('trip_history_view', TripHistoryViewTable)
db.define_table('duo_rating', DuoRatingTable)
db.define_table('duo_realtime', DuoRealtimeTable)
db.define_table('duo_tripe', DuoTripeTable)
```

**Carpool Reservation Creation:**
```python
from applications.portal.modules.trip_reservation import *

# Create carpool reservation with full coordination
def create_carpool_reservation(user_id, origin, destination, departure_time):
    # Create base reservation
    reservation_id = db.reservation.insert(
        user_id=user_id,
        travel_mode=DUO,  # Carpool mode
        role=ROLE_DRIVER,  # Or ROLE_PASSENGER
        origin_latitude=origin['lat'],
        origin_longitude=origin['lng'],
        destination_latitude=destination['lat'],
        destination_longitude=destination['lng'],
        started_on=departure_time,
        status=RESERVATION_STATUS_SEARCHING,
        created_on=datetime.utcnow(),
        modified_on=datetime.utcnow()
    )
    
    # Create carpool-specific data
    db.duo_reservation.insert(
        reservation_id=reservation_id,
        offer_id=reservation_id,  # Self-reference for new offers
        group_id=1,  # Default group
        is_creator=True,
        price=0.0
    )
    
    return reservation_id
```

**Multi-Modal Trip Integration:**
```python
# Support for intermodal transportation
intermodal_reservation = db.reservation.insert(
    user_id=user_id,
    travel_mode=INTERMODAL,  # Multi-modal trip
    origin_latitude=origin_lat,
    origin_longitude=origin_lng,
    destination_latitude=dest_lat,
    destination_longitude=dest_lng,
    started_on=departure_time,
