## üìã Functionality Overview
**Non-technical explanation:** Think of this as the "relationship manager" for a carpooling system. When someone leaves a carpool group or when a group gets deleted, this system figures out what connections need to be broken. Like when someone leaves a company WhatsApp group, their pending invitations and matches with other group members need to be cleaned up so the system stays organized and accurate.

**Technical explanation:** Business logic layer implementing complex carpool relationship management with enterprise-scale mega carpool support. Manages bidirectional data consistency, automated cleanup operations, and real-time statistics updates when group membership changes occur.

**Business value:** Ensures data integrity and accurate matching statistics while supporting enterprise-level carpool operations. Enables seamless scaling across multiple organizations within mega carpool networks, maintaining user experience quality during membership transitions.

**System context:** Critical business logic component that bridges group management, reservation systems, and matching algorithms, ensuring consistent state across all carpool-related data structures.

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis
**Core Algorithm - Group Member Discovery:**
```python
def get_same_group_user(db, user_id):
    # Step 1: Get user's groups
    groups1 = db(
        (db.group_member.user_id == user_id) &
        (db.group_member.member_status > 1) &  # Active members only
        (db.duo_group.disabled == False)
    ).select()
    
    # Step 2: Handle mega carpool enterprise expansion
    enterprise_ids = [x.enterprise_id for x in groups1 if x.enterprise_id]
    if enterprise_ids:
        # Find related enterprises in mega carpool network
        targets = db1(
            db1.mega_carpool_organizations.org_id.belongs(enterprise_ids)
        ).select()
        # Add additional enterprise groups
    
    # Step 3: Return all members from expanded group set
    return member_user_ids
```

**Invitation Cleanup Logic:**
```python
def remove_invites_for_group(db, reservation_ids):
    # Find all invitations involving target reservations
    rows = db(
        (db.duo_reservation.reservation_id.belongs(reservation_ids) |
         db.duo_reservation.offer_id.belongs(reservation_ids)) &
        (db.reservation.status == RESERVATION_STATUS_SEARCHING)
    ).select()
    
    # Validate each invitation against current group membership
    for row in rows:
        member_ids = get_same_group_user(db, row.reservation.user_id)
        if row.invited_user.user_id not in member_ids:
            # Remove invalid invitation
            row.duo_reservation.delete_record()
```

**Statistics Update Algorithm:**
```python
def update_matching_statistic2(db, reservation_ids):
    for reservation_id in reservation_ids:
        # Count sent invitations
        invite_sent = _get_sent_invites(reservation_id)
        # Count received invitations  
        invite_received = _get_received_invites(reservation_id)
        # Count pure matches (no invitations)
        matches = db(match_statistic.reservation_id == reservation_id).select()
        
        # Update or insert statistics record
        if existing_record:
            update_record(invite_sent=len(invite_sent), ...)
        else:
            insert(invite_sent=len(invite_sent), ...)
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Complexity**: O(n*m) where n = reservations, m = average group size
- **Database Operations**: Multiple joins with potential for N+1 queries
- **Memory Usage**: Linear with number of active reservations
- **I/O Pattern**: Read-heavy with batch updates

## üöÄ Usage Methods
**Group Member Removal:**
```python
from applications.portal.modules.carpool.matching_handler import process_carpool_relation_for_group

# When user leaves a group
def remove_user_from_group(db, group_id, user_id):
    # Remove membership record
    db((db.group_member.group_id == group_id) &
       (db.group_member.user_id == user_id)).delete()
    
    # Clean up related carpool data
    process_carpool_relation_for_group(db, group_id, user_id)
```

**Group Deletion Cleanup:**
```python
def delete_carpool_group(db, group_id):
    # Mark group as disabled
    db(db.duo_group.id == group_id).update(disabled=True)
    
    # Clean up all member relationships
    process_carpool_relation_for_group(db, group_id, user_id=None)
    
    # Remove all group members
    db(db.group_member.group_id == group_id).delete()
```

**Mega Carpool Integration:**
```python
def get_enterprise_carpool_members(db, user_id):
    # Get users from same groups including mega carpool expansion
    same_group_users = get_same_group_user(db, user_id)
    
    # Use for matching algorithms
    potential_matches = db(
        db.reservation.user_id.belongs(same_group_users) &
        db.reservation.status == RESERVATION_STATUS_SEARCHING
    ).select()
```

**Statistics Maintenance:**
```python
# Scheduled maintenance task
def update_all_matching_statistics(db):
    active_reservations = db(
        db.reservation.status == RESERVATION_STATUS_SEARCHING
    ).select(db.reservation.id)
    
    reservation_ids = [r.id for r in active_reservations]
    update_matching_statistic2(db, reservation_ids)
```

## üìä Output Examples
**Group Member Discovery Results:**
```python
# User 12345's group members including mega carpool expansion
>>> get_same_group_user(db, 12345)
[12346, 12347, 12348, 15001, 15002, 15003]  # Last 3 from mega carpool

# Enterprise expansion example
User 12345 belongs to Enterprise 1001
Enterprise 1001 is in Mega Carpool Network A
Network A includes Enterprises [1001, 1002, 1003]
Result includes members from all 3 enterprises
```

**Invitation Cleanup Log:**
```bash
[DEBUG] [get_same_group_user] enter, user_id: 12345
[DEBUG] [get_same_group_user] with enterprise_id
[DEBUG] [Duo] Remove reservation(67890) invite reservation(67891)
[DEBUG] [Duo] No other invite so remove reservation(67891) be invited relationship
[INFO] [update_matching_statistic2] enter
```

**Matching Statistics Update:**
```python
# Before cleanup
reservation_match_record = {
    'reservation_id': 67890,
    'invite_sent': 3,
    'invite_received': 2, 
    'matches': 5,
    'modified_on': '2024-01-15 10:30:00'
}

# After member removal cleanup  
updated_record = {
    'reservation_id': 67890,
    'invite_sent': 2,      # Reduced by 1
    'invite_received': 1,   # Reduced by 1
    'matches': 3,          # Reduced by 2
    'modified_on': '2024-01-15 10:35:00'
}
```

**Database Impact Analysis:**
```sql
-- Typical cleanup operation affects:
DELETE FROM duo_reservation WHERE id IN (1001, 1002, 1003);
DELETE FROM match_statistic WHERE id IN (2001, 2002);
UPDATE reservation_match SET invite_sent = 2, matches = 3 WHERE reservation_id = 67890;
-- 3 DELETE operations, 1 UPDATE operation per affected reservation
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
**Performance Considerations:**
- **N+1 Query Problem**: `get_same_group_user()` can generate multiple database queries for large enterprise networks
- **Transaction Boundaries**: No explicit transaction management - relies on Web2py auto-commit
- **Bulk Operations**: Statistics updates process reservations individually, not in batch
- **Database Locks**: Multiple concurrent updates may cause lock contention

**Data Consistency Warnings:**
- **Cascade Effects**: Removing one member can affect statistics for many other users
- **Timing Issues**: Statistics updates occur after deletions, creating temporary inconsistency
- **Rollback Complexity**: No easy rollback mechanism if partial cleanup fails
- **Concurrent Modifications**: Race conditions possible if multiple cleanup operations run simultaneously

**Enterprise Integration Complexity:**
- **Cross-Database Queries**: Mega carpool queries span multiple database connections
- **Network Latency**: Secondary database calls may introduce performance delays
- **Data Synchronization**: No verification that db1 mega carpool data is current
- **Error Handling**: Limited error handling for mega carpool database failures

**Security and Privacy:**
- **Data Exposure**: Group member discovery reveals user relationships across enterprises
- **Permission Checks**: No validation that calling user has permission to trigger cleanup
- **Audit Trail**: Limited logging of who initiated cleanup operations
- **Data Retention**: No consideration of data retention policies during cleanup
