üìã **Functionality Overview**
- **Non-technical explanation:** Like a smart campaign manager that automatically sends personalized mobility suggestions (go early, change transport mode, take surveys) to users at the right time, tracks their responses, awards points, and handles follow-up communications. Think of it as a personal mobility assistant that learns from user behavior and provides timely travel recommendations, or an automated marketing system that delivers contextual messages based on travel patterns.
- **Technical explanation:** Event-driven campaign orchestration engine implementing state machine patterns for user engagement workflows, featuring notification delivery, response tracking, point calculation, and retry mechanisms with location-aware timing logic.
- **Business value:** Enables automated user engagement campaigns, improves mobility behavior change through incentives, reduces manual campaign management overhead, and provides data-driven insights into user travel patterns.
- **System context:** Core business logic layer of the ConnectSmart mobility platform's campaign management system, interfacing with notification services, database layer, and location tracking components.

üîß **Technical Specifications**
- **File info:** `campaign_handler.py`, 488 lines, Business logic module, Python, ~20KB, Complexity: High (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ)
- **Core functions:** 14 main functions with specialized campaign processing logic
- **Dependencies:**
  - `define` module (Critical): Campaign constants and notification types
  - `notification` module (Critical): Push notification delivery system
  - `gluon.current` (Critical): Web2py database context
  - `json`, `datetime`, `time`, `logging` (Required): Standard Python libraries
- **Database tables accessed:** `cm_campaign`, `cm_step`, `cm_campaign_user`, `cm_location`, `cm_user_record`, `cm_microsurvey_record`
- **Notification types:** 12 (INFO), 20 (MICROSURVEY), 21 (GO_EARLY), 24-26 (WTA variants)
- **Timeslot system:** 15-minute intervals, 96 slots per day (24 hours √ó 4)

üìù **Detailed Code Analysis**
- **Core functions breakdown:**
  - `uodtsGenerator(time)`: Generates time range for campaign delivery (¬±2 slots)
  - `cmPushNotification()`: Sends push notifications with validation and error handling
  - `microsurvey_next_card()`: Determines next survey question based on user responses

  - `microsurvey_record()`: Records survey responses and calculates points
  - `resend_card()`: Handles campaign retry logic with timing validation
  - `get_timeslot()`: Converts time string to 15-minute slot number

- **Timeslot calculation algorithm:**
  ```python
  def get_timeslot(time_str):
      timeArr = time_str.split(":")
      slot = round((int(timeArr[0]) * 60 + int(timeArr[1])) / 15)
      return int(slot)  # Returns 0-95 (96 slots per day)
  ```

- **Campaign card types:**
  - **Type 1 (Info Card):** Information delivery without user action required
  - **Type 2 (Go Early):** Travel time optimization suggestions with location data
  - **Type 5 (Microsurvey):** Interactive survey with branching logic

- **Error handling patterns:** Try-catch blocks with detailed logging, graceful degradation, status tracking
- **Memory management:** Efficient database queries with selective field loading
- **Performance characteristics:** Database-intensive operations, JSON parsing overhead, datetime calculations

üöÄ **Usage Methods**
- **Send info card notification:**
  ```python
  from campaign_handler import infocard
  notification = infocard(step_obj, campaign_user_obj)
  # Returns formatted notification dict
  ```

- **Process microsurvey response:**
  ```python
  from campaign_handler import microsurvey_record, microsurvey_next_card
  # Record user response
  success = microsurvey_record(user_id, campaign_id, card_id, step_no, 
                               answer_list, points, status_id)
  # Get next question
  next_step = microsurvey_next_card(choices_dict, user_answers)
  ```

- **Campaign status management:**
  ```python
  from campaign_handler import change_status, ms_change_status
  # Update regular campaign status
  result = change_status(user_id, campaign_id, card_id, status_id, accept_flag)
  # Update microsurvey campaign status
  result = ms_change_status(user_id, campaign_id, status_id, accept_flag)
  ```

- **Resend campaign logic:**
  ```python
  from campaign_handler import resend_card
  # Check and resend expired campaigns
  card_data = resend_card(user_id, resend_duration_minutes)
  if card_data:
      # Process resend notification
      send_notification(card_data)
  ```

üìä **Output Examples**
- **Successful microsurvey card generation:**
  ```json
  {
    "silent": false,
    "user_list": [12345],
    "notification_type": 20,
    "ended_on": "2024-12-01 18:00:00",
    "title": {"en": "How was your trip?"},
    "body": {"en": "Please rate your experience"},
    "meta": {
      "expiration_date": 1733068800,
      "question": {"en": "How was your trip?"},
      "answers": ["Excellent", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"],
      "points": 5.0,
      "card_id": "789"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Go early notification structure:**

  [DEBUG] [userRecordId] 12345
  ```

- **Timeslot calculation examples:**
  ```python
  get_timeslot("08:15:00") ‚Üí 33  # (8*60 + 15) / 15 = 33
  get_timeslot("12:00:00") ‚Üí 48  # (12*60 + 0) / 15 = 48
  get_timeslot("23:45:00") ‚Üí 95  # (23*60 + 45) / 15 = 95
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- **Security considerations:**
  - Validate user permissions before processing campaign actions
  - Sanitize JSON input in choices and answer fields to prevent injection
  - Use parameterized database queries to prevent SQL injection
  - Verify notification recipient authorization

- **Performance gotchas:**
  - `resend_card()` queries can be expensive with large user bases; consider pagination
  - JSON parsing in `microsurvey_next_card()` should validate structure
  - Datetime calculations may cause timezone issues; ensure UTC consistency
  - Database connections should be properly managed in Web2py context

- **Common troubleshooting:**
  - **Notification not sent:** Check notification_type exists in database, verify user permissions
  - **Points not awarded:** Ensure campaign.points field is set, check decimal precision
  - **Timeslot errors:** Validate time format (HH:MM:SS), handle edge cases at midnight
  - **Resend not working:** Verify modified_on timestamps, check campaign status and end_time

- **Breaking changes:** Module relies on Web2py's current.db context; ensure proper initialization
- **Rate limiting:** No built-in rate limiting; implement at application level for high-volume campaigns
