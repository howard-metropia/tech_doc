# carpool_trip_processing.js

## Overview
Job module that handles carpool trip processing through the dedicated carpool service. This lightweight job delegates all carpool trip processing logic to the service layer for clean separation of concerns.

## Purpose
- Process carpool trips for matching and validation
- Handle carpool trip lifecycle management
- Support automated carpool processing workflows
- Maintain carpool system data integrity

## Key Features
- **Service Delegation**: Complete delegation to carpool processing service
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of job scheduling from business logic
- **Lightweight Execution**: Minimal overhead for efficient processing
- **Automated Processing**: Supports scheduled carpool trip management

## Dependencies
```javascript
const service = require('@app/src/services/carpoolTripProcessing');
```

## Core Function Structure
```javascript
module.exports = {
  inputs: {},
  fn: async () => {
    await service.carpoolTripProcessing();
  },
};
```

## Processing Logic
- Direct service call to carpool processing service
- All business logic delegated to service layer
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking execution
- Service-level error handling and logging

## Service Integration
- **Carpool Processing Service**: Primary integration for trip processing
- **Database Layer**: Carpool trip data management
- **Matching Algorithms**: Trip pairing and validation logic
- **Notification System**: User communication for carpool updates

## Usage Patterns
- Scheduled execution for regular carpool processing
- Batch processing of pending carpool trips
- Automated trip validation and matching
- System maintenance for carpool data

## Operational Notes
- Minimal resource requirements
- Fast execution through service delegation
- Compatible with frequent scheduling
- Service-level business logic and error handling
