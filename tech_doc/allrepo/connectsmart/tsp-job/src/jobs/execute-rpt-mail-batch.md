# execute-rpt-mail-batch.js

## Overview
Job module that executes report mail batches, processing and sending scheduled email reports to configured mailing lists. This job handles the actual delivery of batched email reports.

## Purpose
- Execute prepared mail batches for report distribution
- Process and send scheduled email reports
- Handle batch email delivery workflows
- Complete the report distribution pipeline

## Key Features
- **Batch Execution**: Processes prepared mail batches for delivery
- **Email Distribution**: Handles actual sending of report emails
- **Service Integration**: Leverages report mail service for execution logic
- **Workflow Completion**: Final step in automated report distribution

## Dependencies
```javascript
const service = require('@app/src/services/reportMail');
```

## Core Function Structure
```javascript
module.exports = {
  inputs: {},
  fn: async function() {
    await service.executeMailList();
  }
};
```

## Processing Logic
- Direct service call to report mail service
- Batch execution through `executeMailList()` method
- Asynchronous processing for efficient email delivery
- Service-level handling of delivery logic and error management

## Integration Points
- **Report Mail Service**: Primary integration for batch execution
- **Email System**: Actual email delivery processing
- **Database Layer**: Batch status tracking and completion logging
- **Job Scheduler**: Coordinated execution timing

## Usage Patterns
- Scheduled execution after batch and list preparation
- Final step in automated report distribution pipeline
- Batch processing of queued email reports
- System completion of email workflows

## Service Delegation
All functionality delegated to `@app/src/services/reportMail`:
- Mail batch execution logic
- Email delivery processing
- Batch completion tracking
- Error handling and retry logic

## Operational Notes
- Resource-intensive operation during email sending
- Execution time varies with batch size
- Requires proper email service configuration
- Handles delivery failures through service-level logic
