## Core Workflow Architecture

### Main Job Execution Flow
```javascript
const job = async () => {
  // 1. Event Discovery Phase
  const ongoingEvents = await searchOngoingEvents();
  const clearedEvents = await searchClearEvents();

  // 2. User Impact Analysis Phase  
  const ongoingFavorites = await fetchOngoingRouteFavorites(ongoingEvents);
  const ongoingReservations = await fetchOngoingReservations(ongoingEvents);
  const clearFavorites = await fetchClearFavorites(clearedEvents);
  const clearReservations = await fetchClearReservations(clearedEvents);

  // 3. User Preference Filtering Phase
  const filteredOngoingRoutes = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(ongoingFavorites);
  const filteredOngoingReservations = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(ongoingReservations);
  const requiredClearedFavorites = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(clearFavorites);
  const requiredClearedReservations = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(clearReservations);

  // 4. Duplicate Prevention Phase
  const requiredOngoingFavorites = await filterExistingNotifications(filteredOngoingRoutes);
  const requiredOngoingReservations = await filterExistingNotifications(filteredOngoingReservations);

  // 5. Notification Delivery Phase
  await notifyFavoriteRoute(NotificationType.OngoingAlert, requiredOngoingFavorites);
  await notifyFavoriteRoute(NotificationType.ClearAlert, requiredClearedFavorites);
  await notifyReservation(NotificationType.OngoingAlert, requiredOngoingReservations);
  await notifyReservation(NotificationType.ClearAlert, requiredClearedReservations);
};
```

## Event Discovery Phase

### Ongoing Events Detection
```javascript
const ongoingEvents = await searchOngoingEvents();
```

**Ongoing Event Criteria**:
- Active transit service disruptions
- Route delays and cancellations
- Station closures and accessibility issues
- Equipment failures affecting service
- Weather-related service impacts

### Cleared Events Detection
```javascript
const clearedEvents = await searchClearEvents();
```

**Cleared Event Criteria**:
- Recently resolved service disruptions
- Restored normal service operations
- Reopened stations and routes
- Fixed equipment and infrastructure
- Ended weather-related impacts

## User Impact Analysis

### Favorite Route Analysis
```javascript
const ongoingFavorites = await fetchOngoingRouteFavorites(ongoingEvents);
const clearFavorites = await fetchClearFavorites(clearedEvents);
```

**Favorite Route Logic**:
- **User Route Preferences**: Matches events to user's saved favorite routes
- **Route-Event Correlation**: Identifies overlapping routes and affected segments
- **Impact Assessment**: Determines severity and duration of route impacts
- **Historical Patterns**: Considers user's typical travel patterns

### Reservation Impact Analysis
```javascript
const ongoingReservations = await fetchOngoingReservations(ongoingEvents);
const clearReservations = await fetchClearReservations(clearedEvents);
```

**Reservation Logic**:
- **Active Reservations**: Finds users with current or upcoming transit reservations
- **Route Matching**: Correlates reservations with affected transit services
- **Time Sensitivity**: Prioritizes notifications for imminent travel times
- **Alternative Options**: Provides information about alternate routes or services

## User Preference Filtering

### Notification Configuration Filtering
```javascript
const filteredOngoingRoutes = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(ongoingFavorites);
const filteredOngoingReservations = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(ongoingReservations);
const requiredClearedFavorites = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(clearFavorites);
const requiredClearedReservations = await filterNotificationByUserConfig(clearReservations);
```

**User Configuration Options**:
- **Transit Alerts Enabled/Disabled**: Global transit notification preference
- **Severity Threshold**: Minimum disruption level for notifications
- **Time Window**: Hours before travel time to receive alerts
- **Route Specificity**: Notifications only for specific routes vs all favorites
- **Notification Channels**: Push, SMS, email preferences

### Configuration Processing Logic
The service layer handles complex user preference logic including:
- **Quiet Hours**: Respecting user's do-not-disturb settings
- **Frequency Limits**: Preventing notification spam
- **Priority Levels**: Different handling for severe vs minor disruptions
- **Channel Preferences**: Routing notifications to preferred delivery methods

## Duplicate Prevention System

### Existing Notification Filtering
```javascript
const requiredOngoingFavorites = await filterExistingNotifications(filteredOngoingRoutes);
const requiredOngoingReservations = await filterExistingNotifications(filteredOngoingReservations);
```

**Duplicate Prevention Logic**:
- **Notification History**: Tracks previously sent notifications per user/event
- **Time Window**: Prevents duplicate notifications within specified timeframe
- **Event Changes**: Only notifies on significant event updates
- **Status Changes**: Tracks event status transitions (ongoing â†’ resolved)

### Smart Notification Management
```javascript
// Only ongoing events need duplicate filtering
// Cleared events are inherently unique state changes
```

**Filtering Strategy**:
- **Ongoing Alerts**: Require duplicate filtering to prevent spam
- **Clear Alerts**: Don't require duplicate filtering (state change is unique)
- **Event Evolution**: Tracks how events change over time
- **User Fatigue**: Prevents over-notification of the same issue

## Notification Delivery Phase

### Favorite Route Notifications
```javascript
await notifyFavoriteRoute(NotificationType.OngoingAlert, requiredOngoingFavorites);
await notifyFavoriteRoute(NotificationType.ClearAlert, requiredClearedFavorites);
```

**Favorite Route Messaging**:
- **Route-Specific**: Tailored messages mentioning specific route names
- **Impact Details**: Duration, severity, and affected segments
- **Alternative Suggestions**: Recommended alternate routes
- **Time Estimates**: Expected resolution times when available

### Reservation Notifications
```javascript
await notifyReservation(NotificationType.OngoingAlert, requiredOngoingReservations);
await notifyReservation(NotificationType.ClearAlert, requiredClearedReservations);
```

**Reservation Messaging**:
- **Time-Sensitive**: Urgent notifications for imminent reservations
- **Cancellation Options**: Easy access to reservation modification
- **Rebooking Assistance**: Alternative time slots and routes
- **Refund Information**: Policy details for affected reservations

## Service Layer Architecture

### Comprehensive Service Integration
The job delegates all business logic to the `transitAlert` service, which provides:

- **Event Management**: Detection and categorization of transit events
- **User Matching**: Sophisticated algorithms for user-event correlation  
- **Preference Engine**: Complex user notification preference processing
- **Delivery System**: Multi-channel notification delivery infrastructure
- **Analytics**: User engagement and notification effectiveness tracking

### Service Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Job focuses on orchestration, service handles logic
- **Testability**: Service functions can be tested independently
- **Reusability**: Service functions used by other components
- **Maintainability**: Business logic centralized in service layer

## Performance Characteristics

### Efficient Processing Pipeline
```javascript
// Sequential processing with minimal data transfer
const events = await searchEvents();                    // Fetch once
const userMatches = await fetchAffectedUsers(events);   // Process matches
const filtered = await applyFilters(userMatches);       // Apply preferences
await deliverNotifications(filtered);                   // Send notifications
```

**Performance Optimizations**:
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple events and users efficiently
- **Minimal Database Calls**: Optimized query patterns
- **Parallel Operations**: Where possible, concurrent processing
- **Memory Management**: Streams large datasets without memory issues

### Scalability Considerations
