# token-notification.js

## Overview
Simple job for processing token-related notifications including token acquisition and expiration alerts. Delegates to specialized token notification services for handling user notifications about token status changes.

## File Location
- **Path**: `/allrepo/connectsmart/tsp-job/src/jobs/token-notification.js`
- **Module Type**: Scheduled Job
- **Export**: Job configuration with async function

## Key Dependencies
- `@maas/core/log` - Logging utility
- `@app/src/services/tokenNotification` - Token notification service functions

## Core Functions

### Main Function
Orchestrates token notification processing by calling service functions sequentially.

**Process Flow:**
1. Log job startup
2. Execute token acquisition notifications
3. Execute token expiration notifications

## Job Configuration

### Inputs
No input parameters required.

### Service Integration
Utilizes two primary service functions:
- `tokenGetNotification()` - Handles token acquisition notifications
- `tokenExpireNotification()` - Handles token expiration notifications

## Processing Flow

### 1. Job Initialization
```javascript
logger.info('[token-notification] job started.');
```

### 2. Token Acquisition Processing
```javascript
await tokenGetNotification();
```

### 3. Token Expiration Processing
```javascript
await tokenExpireNotification();
```

## Business Logic

### Token Lifecycle Management
- **Acquisition**: Notifies users when tokens are successfully obtained
- **Expiration**: Alerts users about upcoming or past token expirations
- **Sequential Processing**: Ensures proper order of notification handling

### Service Delegation
- Minimal job logic, delegates to specialized services
- Clean separation of concerns between job scheduling and notification logic
- Service functions handle all business logic and data processing

## Integration Points
- Token management system
- User notification services
- Token lifecycle tracking
- Authentication and authorization systems

## Error Handling
- Relies on service function error handling
- Service functions responsible for logging and error management
- Job continues processing even if individual services encounter issues

## Performance Considerations
- Lightweight job wrapper with minimal overhead
- Service functions handle optimization and efficiency
- Sequential processing ensures data consistency

## Usage Scenarios
- Daily token status monitoring
- User authentication maintenance
- Token lifecycle management
- Proactive user notification about token issues

## Service Function Responsibilities

### tokenGetNotification()
Likely handles:
- New token issuance notifications
- Token refresh confirmations
- Authentication success alerts

### tokenExpireNotification()
Likely handles:
- Upcoming expiration warnings
- Expired token alerts
- Re-authentication reminders

## Logging
- Job startup confirmation
- Service function execution tracking
- Error logging delegated to service functions

## Configuration Dependencies
- Service function configurations
- Token management settings
- Notification delivery preferences
- User preference settings

## Notes
- Minimal job implementation focused on orchestration
- Service-oriented architecture for maintainability
- Clean abstraction between scheduling and business logic
- Designed for regular scheduled execution
- Extensible for additional token notification types
