# check_escrow_detail.js - Escrow Detail Migration Validation Job

## Quick Summary

The `check_escrow_detail.js` job is a comprehensive data integrity validation tool designed to verify the accuracy of migrated escrow detail records. This job performs cross-table comparisons between the original `escrow_detail` table and the upgraded `escrow_detail_upgrade` table, ensuring that migration processes have maintained data consistency and relational integrity. The job implements systematic field-by-field validation and comprehensive relationship checking between related tables.

## Technical Analysis

### Core Architecture

The job implements a dual-validation approach with two primary verification phases:

1. **Data Comparison Phase** - Field-by-field validation using a custom `Checker` class
2. **Relationship Validation Phase** - Cross-table relationship integrity verification

### Key Components

#### Checker Class Implementation
```javascript
function Checker(obj1, obj2, result) {
  this.obj1 = obj1;
  this.obj2 = obj2;
  this.result = result;
  this.check = function (key) {
    if (this.obj1[key] === this.obj2[key]) {
      this.result.success++;
    } else {
      logger.warn(`${key} check failed ${this.obj1[key]} : ${this.obj2[key]}`);
      this.result.fail++;
    }
    return this;
  };
}
```

The Checker class provides a fluent interface for chained validation operations, enabling efficient field comparison with automatic result tracking and detailed logging for discrepancies.

#### Data Comparison Logic
```javascript
async function compareWithOldData() {
  const list = await knex('escrow_detail_upgrade');
  const result = { success: 0, fail: 0 };
  for (const t of list) {
    const old = await knex('escrow_detail').where({ id: t.ori_id });
    const checker = new Checker(t, old[0], result);
    checker
      .check('escrow_id')
      .check('activity_type')
      .check('fund')
      .check('offer_id')
      .check('created_on')
      .check('modified_on');
  }
  return result;
}
```

#### Relationship Validation Logic
The relationship checking function performs complex multi-table validation:
- Validates transaction ID relationships between `points_transaction_upgrade` and `points_transaction`
- Verifies escrow ID consistency across escrow tables
- Implements null-safe comparison logic for missing records

### Database Schema Dependencies

The job operates across multiple interconnected tables:
- `escrow_detail_upgrade` - Target migration table
- `escrow_detail` - Source legacy table  
- `points_transaction_upgrade` - Related transaction records
- `points_transaction` - Legacy transaction records
- `escrow` - Parent escrow records

### Error Handling Strategy

The job implements comprehensive error handling with structured logging:
```javascript
try {
  // Validation logic
} catch (e) {
  logger.warn(`[compareWithOldData] error: ${e.message}`);
}
```

All errors are captured and logged with contextual information, allowing for detailed troubleshooting of migration issues.

## Usage/Integration

### Job Execution Context

This job is typically executed as part of a data migration validation pipeline, running after the initial escrow detail migration has been completed. The job is designed to be run on-demand or as part of automated migration verification workflows.

### Validation Assertions

The job uses Chai assertions to enforce strict validation requirements:
```javascript
assert(check1.fail === 0, 'expect compareWithOldData fail number is zero');
assert(check2.fail === 0, 'expect checkRelation fail number is zero');
```

Any validation failure will cause the job to throw an assertion error, halting execution and alerting operators to data integrity issues.

### Performance Monitoring

The job includes built-in performance tracking:
```javascript
const start = new Date().getTime();
// ... validation logic ...
const end = new Date().getTime();
logger.info(`Time taken: ${(end - start) / 1000} secs`);
```

### Integration Points

- **Migration Pipeline** - Executed after escrow detail migration completion
- **Quality Assurance** - Part of data integrity verification workflows  
- **Monitoring Systems** - Logs are consumed by centralized logging infrastructure
- **Alert Systems** - Assertion failures trigger operational alerts

## Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **@maas/core/mysql** - Database connectivity and query execution
- **@maas/core/log** - Structured logging infrastructure
- **chai** - Assertion library for validation enforcement

### Database Requirements
- MySQL portal database with read access to multiple tables
- Sufficient database connection pool capacity for concurrent queries
- Proper indexing on `id` and `ori_id` fields for optimal performance

### External Service Dependencies
- **Database Connection Pool** - Requires available connections during execution
- **Logging Infrastructure** - Centralized log aggregation system
- **Monitoring Systems** - Performance metrics collection endpoints

## Code Examples

### Basic Job Execution
```javascript
const job = require('./check_escrow_detail');
await job.fn();
```

### Custom Validation with Checker Class
```javascript
const result = { success: 0, fail: 0 };
const checker = new Checker(sourceRecord, targetRecord, result);
checker
  .check('escrow_id')
  .check('activity_type')
  .check('fund');

console.log(`Validation completed: ${result.success} success, ${result.fail} failures`);
```

### Manual Relationship Validation
```javascript
async function validateEscrowRelationship(upgradeRecord) {
  const oldRecord = await knex('escrow_detail').where({ id: upgradeRecord.ori_id });
  if (oldRecord.length > 0 && upgradeRecord.transaction_id > 0) {
    const newTransaction = await knex('points_transaction_upgrade')
      .where({ id: upgradeRecord.transaction_id });
    const oldTransaction = await knex('points_transaction')
      .where({ id: oldRecord[0].transaction_id });
    
    return newTransaction[0]?.ori_id === oldTransaction[0]?.id;
  }
  return false;
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
try {
  const validationResult = await compareWithOldData();
  if (validationResult.fail > 0) {
    throw new Error(`Validation failed with ${validationResult.fail} errors`);
  }
} catch (error) {
  logger.error(`Validation job failed: ${error.message}`);
  throw error; // Re-throw for upstream handling
}
```

This validation job serves as a critical component in ensuring data migration integrity, providing detailed verification of both data accuracy and relational consistency across the escrow detail migration process.
