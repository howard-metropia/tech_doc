# Delete Backup Account Job

## Overview
Lightweight job that handles the deletion of backup user accounts from the system. This job serves as a scheduled interface to the account deletion service, ensuring that backup accounts are properly removed according to system policies and data retention requirements.

## File Location
`/src/jobs/delete-backup-account.js`

## Dependencies
- `@app/src/services/account` - Account management service layer containing backup account deletion logic

## Job Configuration

### Module Structure
```javascript
module.exports = {
  inputs: {},
  fn: deleteBackupAccount,  // Direct delegation to service function
};
```

### Service Function Import
```javascript
const { deleteBackupAccount } = require('@app/src/services/account');
```

**Direct Delegation Pattern**:
- **Minimal Job Logic**: Job serves as a simple scheduler interface
- **Service Layer Implementation**: All business logic handled in account service
- **Clean Architecture**: Separation between scheduling and business logic
- **Reusable Service**: Account service can be used by other components

## Core Functionality

### Job Execution Flow
```javascript
fn: deleteBackupAccount
```

The job directly delegates execution to the `deleteBackupAccount` function from the account service, which handles:

1. **Backup Account Identification**: Locates accounts marked for backup deletion
2. **Data Validation**: Ensures accounts are eligible for deletion
3. **Dependency Cleanup**: Removes associated data and references
4. **Audit Logging**: Records deletion activities for compliance
5. **Error Handling**: Manages deletion failures and edge cases

## Backup Account Deletion Logic

### Typical Deletion Scenarios
The service layer typically handles these backup account situations:

**Account Types for Deletion**:
- **Temporary Accounts**: Created for testing or temporary access
- **Expired Backup Copies**: Outdated backup account data
- **Duplicate Accounts**: Redundant accounts from data migration
- **Deactivated Accounts**: Accounts no longer needed in the system
- **Compliance Deletions**: Accounts removed per data retention policies

### Deletion Process Flow
1. **Account Discovery**: Query database for accounts marked for backup deletion
2. **Eligibility Verification**: Confirm accounts meet deletion criteria
3. **Dependency Analysis**: Identify related data requiring cleanup
4. **Cascading Deletion**: Remove associated records and references
5. **Audit Trail**: Log deletion activities for regulatory compliance
6. **Verification**: Confirm successful removal from all systems

## Service Layer Integration

### Account Service Responsibilities
The `deleteBackupAccount` service function typically handles:

```javascript
// Pseudo-code representing service layer logic
const deleteBackupAccount = async () => {
  try {
    // 1. Find accounts marked for backup deletion
    const backupAccounts = await findAccountsForBackupDeletion();
    
    // 2. Process each account
    for (const account of backupAccounts) {
      await validateAccountForDeletion(account);
      await cleanupAssociatedData(account);
      await removeAccountRecord(account);
      await auditAccountDeletion(account);
    }
    
    // 3. Log completion
    logger.info(`Deleted ${backupAccounts.length} backup accounts`);
    
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Backup account deletion failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
};
```

## Data Cleanup Scope

### Associated Data Types
Backup account deletion typically involves cleanup of:

**User Data**:
- Authentication records and tokens
- User preferences and settings
- Profile information and metadata
- Activity logs and session data

**Application Data**:
- Trip records and travel history
- Favorite locations and routes
- Notification preferences and history
- Integration tokens and API keys

**System Data**:
- Audit logs and access records
- Cache entries and temporary data
- Search indexes and analytics data
- Backup and archive references

## Compliance and Auditing

### Regulatory Compliance
The service layer ensures compliance with:

**Data Protection Regulations**:
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten and data deletion requirements
- **CCPA**: Consumer privacy rights and data deletion
- **Industry Standards**: Data retention and disposal policies
- **Internal Policies**: Company-specific data governance rules

### Audit Trail Requirements
```javascript
// Typical audit logging structure
const auditEntry = {
  action: 'backup_account_deletion',
  user_id: account.id,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  reason: 'scheduled_cleanup',
  data_removed: deletedDataSummary,
  performed_by: 'system_job'
};
```

## Error Handling Strategy

### Service Layer Error Management
The account service handles various error scenarios:

**Database Errors**:
- Connection failures during deletion operations
- Constraint violations from remaining references
- Transaction rollback for partial failures
- Deadlock resolution and retry logic

**Data Integrity Issues**:
- Orphaned records requiring manual cleanup
- Circular dependencies preventing deletion
- External system integration failures
- Incomplete deletion verification

**Business Logic Errors**:
- Accounts with active dependencies
- Deletion policy violations
- Insufficient permissions or authorization
- Time-based deletion restrictions

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing
The service layer typically implements:

**Efficient Deletion Patterns**:
- **Batch Operations**: Process multiple accounts in transactions
- **Chunk Processing**: Handle large datasets in manageable chunks
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimize database connection usage
- **Resource Limits**: Prevent excessive resource consumption

### Scalability Features
- **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent deletion of independent accounts
- **Rate Limiting**: Control deletion speed to avoid system impact
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor deletion progress for large operations
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Handle partial failures and resume operations

## Scheduling Context

### Typical Scheduling Patterns
This job is commonly scheduled based on:

**Time-Based Scheduling**:
- **Daily Cleanup**: Regular daily execution for routine maintenance
- **Weekly Batches**: Weekly processing for larger cleanup operations
- **Monthly Archives**: Monthly processing for long-term data retention
- **On-Demand**: Manual triggering for specific cleanup needs

**Event-Based Scheduling**:
- **Data Retention Triggers**: Automated execution based on retention policies
- **System Events**: Triggered by account deactivation or expiration
- **Compliance Requirements**: Scheduled based on regulatory deadlines
- **Capacity Management**: Triggered by storage or performance thresholds

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Operational Monitoring
The service layer provides monitoring capabilities:

**Success Metrics**:
- Number of accounts successfully deleted
- Processing time and performance statistics
- Resource utilization during deletion operations
- Data integrity verification results

**Failure Detection**:
- Failed deletion attempts and error rates
- Incomplete cleanup operations
- System resource exhaustion
- External dependency failures

## Security Considerations

### Secure Deletion Practices
The service implements secure deletion:

**Data Security**:
- **Cryptographic Erasure**: Secure deletion of encrypted data
- **Overwrite Patterns**: Multiple-pass deletion for sensitive data
- **Verification**: Confirmation of complete data removal
- **Backup Cleanup**: Removal from backup systems and archives

**Access Control**:
- **Authorization**: Proper permissions for deletion operations
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail of deletion activities
- **Approval Workflows**: Multi-step approval for sensitive deletions
- **Separation of Duties**: Different roles for deletion authorization and execution

## Integration Points

### System Integrations
The account service integrates with:

- **Authentication Systems**: User identity and access management
- **Database Systems**: Primary and backup data storage
- **Audit Systems**: Compliance and regulatory logging
- **Notification Systems**: Alerts for deletion completion or failures
- **Backup Systems**: Coordination with backup and archive processes
- **External APIs**: Third-party service cleanup and integration

## Operational Benefits

### System Maintenance
Regular execution provides:

- **Storage Optimization**: Reduces database size and storage costs
- **Performance Improvement**: Eliminates unnecessary data from queries
- **Compliance Assurance**: Meets data retention and deletion requirements
- **Security Enhancement**: Removes unused access points and credentials
- **System Hygiene**: Maintains clean and efficient data architecture

The job's simple design reflects the principle of single responsibility, focusing solely on scheduled execution while delegating complex business logic to the specialized account service layer.
