# add-rpt-mail-batch.js

## Overview
Job module that manages the creation of report mail batches through the report mail service. This lightweight job handles batch processing setup for automated email report distribution.

## Purpose
- Create report mail batches for scheduled distribution
- Initialize batch processing for email reports
- Support automated report delivery workflows
- Manage batch creation lifecycle

## Key Features
- **Batch Creation**: Automated setup of mail batches for report distribution
- **Service Integration**: Clean separation with dedicated report mail service
- **Lightweight Execution**: Minimal overhead for batch initialization
- **Automated Workflow**: Supports scheduled batch processing pipeline

## Dependencies
```javascript
const service = require('@app/src/services/reportMail');
```

## Core Function Structure
```javascript
module.exports = {
  inputs: {},
  fn: async function() {
    await service.addMailBatch();
  }
};
```

## Processing Logic
- Direct service call to report mail service
- Batch creation through `addMailBatch()` method
- Asynchronous processing for non-blocking execution
- Service-level error handling and logging

## Integration Points
- **Report Mail Service**: Primary integration for batch management
- **Job Scheduler**: Automated execution timing
- **Email System**: Downstream batch processing
- **Database Layer**: Batch record creation and tracking

## Usage Patterns
- Scheduled execution for regular batch creation
- Part of automated report distribution pipeline
- Batch processing initialization for email workflows
- System maintenance and report preparation

## Service Delegation
All business logic delegated to `@app/src/services/reportMail`:
- Batch creation logic
- Database operations
- Error handling
- Logging and monitoring

## Operational Notes
- Minimal resource requirements
- Fast execution for batch setup
- Compatible with frequent scheduling
- Safe for concurrent execution with proper service-level locking
