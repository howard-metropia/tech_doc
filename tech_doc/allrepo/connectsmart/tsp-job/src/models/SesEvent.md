# SesEvent Model

## Overview
MongoDB-based AWS SES (Simple Email Service) event tracking model for the TSP Job system. Captures and stores email delivery events, bounce notifications, and email service analytics for comprehensive email communication monitoring.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const { Schema } = require('mongoose');
const conn = require('@maas/core/mongo')('cache');

// ses_event
const mongoSchema = new Schema({
  Type: { type: String },
  MessageId: { type: String },
  Subject: { type: String },
  Message: { type: String },
  Timestamp: { type: String },
});

const SesEvent = conn.model('ses_event', mongoSchema);
module.exports = SesEvent;
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Cache MongoDB instance
- **Collection**: `ses_event`
- **ODM**: Mongoose with schema validation
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MongoDB connection pool

## Purpose
- AWS SES email event monitoring and tracking
- Email delivery status logging
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Email service analytics and reporting

## Key Features
- Real-time SES event capture
- Comprehensive email delivery tracking
- Bounce and complaint management
- Email service performance monitoring
- Integration with AWS SNS notifications

## Technical Analysis
The SesEvent model provides a centralized logging mechanism for AWS Simple Email Service events. It captures various email lifecycle events including delivery confirmations, bounces, complaints, and sending statistics.

The model uses MongoDB for flexible event storage, allowing for efficient querying and analysis of email delivery patterns. The connection to the cache database ensures high-performance event logging without impacting primary application databases.

## SES Event Types
- **Send**: Email successfully sent to recipient
- **Delivery**: Email delivered to recipient's mailbox
- **Bounce**: Email rejected by recipient's mail server
- **Complaint**: Recipient marked email as spam
- **Reject**: Amazon SES rejected the email
- **Click**: Recipient clicked link in email (if tracking enabled)
- **Open**: Recipient opened email (if tracking enabled)

## Event Data Structure
Each SES event document contains:
- **Type**: Event classification (send, delivery, bounce, complaint)
- **MessageId**: Unique AWS SES message identifier
- **Subject**: Email subject line for identification
- **Message**: Event details, error messages, or additional information
- **Timestamp**: Event occurrence time in ISO string format

## Integration Points
- **SendEvent**: Internal event triggering system
- **NotificationRecord**: Email notification delivery tracking
- **Notification**: Core notification processing
- **AuthUsers**: User email address management
- **NotificationMsgs**: Email template and content management

## Usage Context
Used throughout the email communication pipeline for:
- Email delivery confirmation and tracking
- Bounce handling and email list management
- Spam complaint processing
- Email service quality monitoring
- Compliance and audit trail maintenance

## Bounce Handling
- **Hard Bounces**: Permanent delivery failures requiring list removal
- **Soft Bounces**: Temporary delivery issues with retry logic
- **Bounce Classification**: Automatic categorization of bounce reasons
- **List Maintenance**: Automated removal of consistently bouncing addresses
- **Reputation Management**: Bounce rate monitoring for sender reputation

## Complaint Management
- **Spam Reports**: Processing recipient spam complaints
- **Automatic Suppression**: Adding complainants to suppression lists
- **Feedback Loops**: ISP complaint processing
- **Reputation Protection**: Maintaining sender reputation scores
- **Compliance**: CAN-SPAM and GDPR compliance support

## Performance Considerations
- MongoDB indexing for efficient event querying
- High-volume event processing capabilities
- Real-time event capture without application delays
- Connection pooling reduces database overhead
- Optimized for write-heavy workloads

## Analytics Applications
- **Delivery Rate Analysis**: Email delivery success metrics
- **Engagement Tracking**: Open and click-through rates
- **Bounce Rate Monitoring**: Email list quality assessment
- **Temporal Analysis**: Email performance over time
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Email marketing performance
- **Service Quality**: SES service reliability metrics

## Security Features
- Secure event data storage and transmission
- Access control through connection management
- PII protection in event logging
- Audit trail for email communication
- Compliance with email privacy regulations

## AWS Integration
- **SES Webhooks**: Direct AWS SES event notifications
- **SNS Integration**: Amazon SNS topic subscriptions
- **CloudWatch Metrics**: AWS monitoring integration
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless event processing
- **S3 Storage**: Long-term event data archival

## API Integration
- Email delivery status endpoints
- Bounce and complaint reporting interfaces
- Analytics and reporting dashboards
- Real-time event streaming
- Email service health monitoring

- NotificationRecord: Email delivery tracking
- Notification: Core notification system
- AuthUsers: User email management
- NotificationMsgs: Email content templates

## Event Processing Workflow
1. **Event Reception**: AWS SES sends event to SNS topic
2. **Event Capture**: Application receives SNS notification
3. **Data Processing**: Event data parsed and validated
4. **Storage**: Event stored in MongoDB collection
5. **Action Triggering**: Automated responses for bounces/complaints
6. **Reporting**: Event data aggregated for analytics

## Quality Assurance
- **Event Validation**: Schema-enforced data integrity
- **Duplicate Detection**: Prevention of duplicate event logging
- **Data Completeness**: Required field validation
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and recovery
- **Performance Monitoring**: Event processing performance tracking

## Monitoring and Alerting
- **Bounce Rate Alerts**: High bounce rate notifications
- **Complaint Monitoring**: Spam complaint threshold alerts
- **Delivery Failure Tracking**: Service outage detection
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time delivery statistics
- **Health Checks**: SES service connectivity monitoring

## Data Retention
- **Event History**: Long-term event data preservation
- **Performance Analysis**: Historical trend analysis
- **Compliance Records**: Regulatory requirement support
- **Data Archival**: Automated old event data management
- **Storage Optimization**: Efficient long-term data storage

## Development Notes
- Minimal schema supports flexible AWS SES event formats
