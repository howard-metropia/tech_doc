# HntbSavingTravelTime Model Documentation

## Overview
HntbSavingTravelTime is a Knex.js-based model that tracks and analyzes travel time savings data for HNTB transportation research studies. This model measures the effectiveness of transportation interventions and optimizations in reducing travel time.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class HntbSavingTravelTime extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'hntb_saving_travel_time';
  }
}
module.exports = HntbSavingTravelTime.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL (`dataset`)
- **Table**: `hntb_saving_travel_time`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql

## Core Functionality

### Travel Time Analysis
- Measures actual vs. predicted travel time differences
- Tracks time savings from route optimizations
- Analyzes temporal patterns in travel time efficiency
- Evaluates intervention effectiveness through time metrics

### Savings Calculation
- Calculates individual trip time savings
- Aggregates savings across user groups and time periods
- Measures cumulative benefits of transportation improvements
- Supports cost-benefit analysis through time valuation

## Usage Patterns

### Time Savings Recording
```javascript
const HntbSavingTravelTime = require('./HntbSavingTravelTime');

// Record travel time savings
const savingsRecord = await HntbSavingTravelTime.query().insert({
  participant_id: participantId,
  trip_id: tripId,
  baseline_travel_time: 45, // minutes
  actual_travel_time: 38,   // minutes
  time_saved: 7,            // minutes
  savings_method: 'route_optimization',
  intervention_type: 'real_time_routing',
  study_condition: 'experimental'
});

// Analyze cumulative savings
const totalSavings = await HntbSavingTravelTime.query()
  .where('study_condition', 'experimental')
  .sum('time_saved as total_minutes_saved');
```
