# DBTrips Model

## Overview
Database model for trip data access in the TSP Job system. Provides comprehensive trip information from the dataset database for analytics, reporting, and trip management operations.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class DBTrips extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'DBTrip';
  }
}
module.exports = DBTrips.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL instance
- **Table**: `DBTrip`
- **ORM**: Objection.js with Knex query builder
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MySQL connection pool

## Purpose
- Trip data access and management
- Transportation analytics
- Route optimization analysis
- Travel pattern insights
- Performance metrics collection

## Key Features
- Comprehensive trip data access
- Dataset database connectivity
- Optimized for analytical queries
- Real-time trip information retrieval
- Historical trip data analysis

## Technical Implementation
The model provides direct access to the DBTrip table in the dataset database, which serves as the primary repository for trip information across all transportation modes and services.

### Database Schema
The `DBTrip` table contains:
- Trip identification and metadata
- Origin and destination coordinates
- Trip duration and distance metrics
- Transportation mode information
- Route and trajectory data
- Trip status and completion details
- User and session correlation
- Timestamp information for trip lifecycle

### Query Operations
```javascript
// Trip retrieval by user
const userTrips = await DBTrips.query()
  .where('user_id', userId)
  .andWhere('trip_date', '>=', startDate)
  .orderBy('trip_date', 'desc')
  .limit(100);

// Trip analytics aggregation
const tripStats = await DBTrips.query()
  .select('transportation_mode')
  .avg('trip_duration as avg_duration')
  .avg('trip_distance as avg_distance')
  .count('* as trip_count')
  .groupBy('transportation_mode');

// Route analysis
const routeData = await DBTrips.query()
  .select('origin_lat', 'origin_lng', 'dest_lat', 'dest_lng')
  .where('trip_status', 'completed')
  .andWhere('created_at', '>=', analysisDate);
```
