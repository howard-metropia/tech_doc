# ClusterTrips Model

## Overview
Trip clustering and pattern analysis model for the TSP Job system. Groups similar trips for analysis, optimization, and pattern recognition.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('portal');
class ClusterTrips extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'cluster_trips';
  }
}
module.exports = ClusterTrips.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Portal MySQL instance
- **Table**: `cluster_trips`
- **ORM**: Objection.js with Knex query builder
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MySQL connection pool

## Purpose
- Trip pattern identification
- Similar trip grouping
- Route optimization analysis
- Demand forecasting support

## Clustering Methods
- **Geographic Clustering**: Location-based grouping
- **Temporal Clustering**: Time-based patterns
- **Behavioral Clustering**: User behavior patterns
- **Route Clustering**: Similar path grouping
- **Modal Clustering**: Transportation mode groups

## Key Features
- Advanced clustering algorithms
- Multi-dimensional analysis
- Pattern recognition capabilities
