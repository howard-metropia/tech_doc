# DuoValidatedResult Model

## Overview
Database model for Duo carpool validation results in the TSP Job system. Stores validation outcomes, verification data, and quality metrics for completed Duo carpool trips to ensure service integrity and accurate incentive distribution.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('portal');
class DuoValidatedResult extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'duo_validated_result';
  }
}
module.exports = DuoValidatedResult.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Portal MySQL instance
- **Table**: `duo_validated_result`
- **ORM**: Objection.js with Knex query builder
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MySQL connection pool

## Purpose
- Carpool trip validation result storage
- Quality assurance and verification tracking
- Incentive calculation validation
- Fraud detection and prevention
- Service quality monitoring

## Key Features
- Comprehensive validation result tracking
- Multi-criteria validation support
- Real-time validation processing
- Quality scoring and metrics
- Fraud detection capabilities

## Technical Implementation
The model stores detailed validation results for Duo carpool trips, including GPS verification, timing validation, user confirmation, and quality metrics. It serves as the authoritative source for determining trip validity and incentive eligibility.

### Database Schema
The `duo_validated_result` table contains:
- Validation identification and metadata
- Associated reservation and trip references
- GPS trajectory validation results
- Timing and schedule compliance data
- User confirmation and feedback scores
- Quality metrics and performance indicators
- Fraud detection flags and analysis
- Validation algorithm version tracking
- Processing timestamps and audit trail

### Validation Operations
```javascript
// Store validation result
const validationResult = await DuoValidatedResult.query().insert({
  reservation_id: reservationId,
  trip_id: tripId,
  validation_status: 'validated',
  gps_validation_score: 0.95,
  timing_validation_score: 0.88,
  user_confirmation_score: 1.0,
  overall_quality_score: 0.91,
  validation_flags: JSON.stringify(['gps_verified', 'timing_confirmed']),
  processed_at: new Date()
});

// Query validation results by criteria
const validatedTrips = await DuoValidatedResult.query()
  .where('validation_status', 'validated')
  .andWhere('overall_quality_score', '>=', 0.8)
  .andWhere('processed_at', '>=', startDate)
  .withGraphFetched('reservation')
  .orderBy('processed_at', 'desc');

// Fraud detection queries
const suspiciousResults = await DuoValidatedResult.query()
  .where('validation_flags', 'like', '%fraud_risk%')
  .orWhere('gps_validation_score', '<', 0.5)
  .andWhere('processed_at', '>=', recentDate);
```
