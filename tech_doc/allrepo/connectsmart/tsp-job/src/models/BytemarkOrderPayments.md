# BytemarkOrderPayments Model Documentation

## Overview
BytemarkOrderPayments is a Knex.js-based model that manages payment transaction records for Bytemark transit orders in the portal MySQL database. This model handles the financial aspects of transit ticket purchases and pass transactions.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('portal');
class BytemarkOrderPayments extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'bytemark_order_payments';
  }
}
module.exports = BytemarkOrderPayments.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Portal MySQL (`portal`)
- **Table**: `bytemark_order_payments`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql

## Core Functionality

### Payment Transaction Management
- Records all payment transactions for Bytemark orders
- Maintains transaction history and status
- Supports payment method tracking and reconciliation
- Handles refunds and payment reversals

### Order Correlation
- Links payments to specific transit orders
- Maintains order-payment relationships
- Supports split payments and partial payments
- Tracks payment completion status

## Usage Patterns

### Transaction Recording
```javascript
const BytemarkOrderPayments = require('./BytemarkOrderPayments');

// Record new payment
const payment = await BytemarkOrderPayments.query().insert({
  order_id: orderId,
  payment_method: 'credit_card',
  amount: orderAmount,
  status: 'completed',
  transaction_id: transactionId
});

// Query payments for order
const orderPayments = await BytemarkOrderPayments.query()
  .where('order_id', orderId);
```

### Financial Reconciliation
- Daily payment reconciliation processes
- Payment status verification
- Failed payment retry handling
- Financial reporting and analytics

## Data Flow
1. **Order Creation**: Payment initiated with order
2. **Processing**: Transaction sent to payment processor
3. **Verification**: Payment status confirmed
4. **Recording**: Transaction details stored
5. **Reconciliation**: Daily financial reconciliation

## Payment States
- **Pending**: Payment initiated but not processed
- **Processing**: Payment being processed by provider
