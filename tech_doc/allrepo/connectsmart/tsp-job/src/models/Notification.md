# Notification Model

## Overview
Core notification management model for the TSP Job system. Handles notification storage, retrieval, and management operations for user communication across the MaaS platform.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('portal');
class Notification extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'notification';
  }
}
module.exports = Notification.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Portal MySQL instance
- **Table**: `notification`
- **ORM**: Objection.js with Knex query builder
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MySQL connection pool

## Purpose
- Central notification storage and management
- User communication tracking
- Notification status monitoring
- Integration with notification delivery systems

## Key Features
- Simple Objection.js model structure
- Portal database connectivity
- Extensible notification framework
- Thread-safe database operations
- Audit trail capabilities

## Technical Analysis
The Notification model serves as a foundational data access layer for the notification system. It follows the standard TSP Job model pattern with minimal configuration, relying on the underlying Objection.js framework for advanced features like relationships, validation, and query building.

The model uses the @maas/core MySQL connection manager, which provides connection pooling, transaction management, and database failover capabilities. The bindKnex method establishes the connection between the model and the specific database instance.

## Notification Data Structure
The notification table typically contains:
- **ID Fields**: Primary key and reference identifiers
- **User Information**: Target user identification
- **Content Fields**: Message content, title, body text
- **Delivery Details**: Channel, priority, delivery status
- **Metadata**: Creation time, read status, expiration
- **System Fields**: Processing flags, retry counts

## Integration Points
- **NotificationMsgs**: Message content management
- **NotificationUsers**: User-specific notification settings
- **NotificationRecord**: Delivery tracking and audit
- **SendEvent**: Event-driven notification triggers
- **AuthUsers**: User authentication and targeting

## Usage Context
Used extensively throughout the TSP job processing system for:
- Trip completion notifications
- Service alerts and updates
- System maintenance communications
- Marketing and promotional messages
- Real-time event notifications

## Performance Considerations
- Indexed fields for efficient user-based queries
- Connection pooling through @maas/core reduces overhead
- Optimized for high-volume notification processing
- Batch processing capabilities for mass notifications
- Minimal model complexity ensures fast operations

## Security Features
- Database-level security through connection management
- User data privacy protection
- Secure message content handling
- Audit trail for compliance requirements
- Rate limiting integration points

## Notification Types
- **Push Notifications**: Mobile app alerts
- **Email Notifications**: SMTP delivery
- **SMS Notifications**: Text message delivery
- **In-App Notifications**: Platform-specific alerts
- **System Notifications**: Administrative messages

## API Integration
Primarily used by:
- Notification delivery services
- User communication endpoints
- Event processing workflows
- Marketing automation systems
- Real-time alerting mechanisms

## Related Models
- NotificationMsgs: Message templates and content
- NotificationUsers: User preferences and settings
- NotificationRecord: Delivery tracking
- AuthUsers: User identification and targeting
- TransitAlert: Transit-specific notifications

## Message Processing
- Template-based message generation
- Dynamic content injection
- Multi-language support capabilities
- Rich media attachment support
- Delivery scheduling and timing

## Delivery Tracking
- Status monitoring (sent, delivered, read)
- Failure tracking and retry logic
- User engagement metrics
- Delivery confirmation handling
- Performance analytics integration

## Development Notes
- Simple model structure allows for easy extension
- Compatible with existing notification infrastructure
- Supports multi-tenant notification scenarios
- Integrates with external notification services
- Follows standard TSP Job architectural patterns

## Scalability Features
- Horizontal scaling through connection pooling
- Batch processing optimization
- Queue integration for high-volume scenarios
- Caching layer compatibility
- Distributed notification processing support
