# Teleworks Model

## Overview
Core telework management model for the TSP Job system. Handles remote work arrangement data, telework policy administration, and workforce mobility analytics within the MaaS platform's enterprise and government service offerings.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('portal');
class Teleworks extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'telework';
  }
}
module.exports = Teleworks.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Portal MySQL instance
- **Table**: `telework`
- **ORM**: Objection.js with Knex query builder
- **Connection**: Managed by @maas/core MySQL connection pool

## Purpose
- Telework arrangement tracking and management
- Remote work policy compliance monitoring
- Workforce mobility pattern analysis
- Transportation demand management integration

## Key Features
- Simple Objection.js model structure
- Portal database connectivity
- Enterprise telework program support
- Transportation impact analysis capabilities
- Policy compliance tracking

## Technical Analysis
The Teleworks model serves as the foundation for managing remote work arrangements within the broader MaaS ecosystem. It integrates with transportation demand management systems to understand the impact of telework policies on commute patterns and transportation usage.

The model follows the standard TSP Job pattern using Objection.js ORM with MySQL storage. It connects to the portal database through the @maas/core connection manager, ensuring consistent database access patterns across the application.
