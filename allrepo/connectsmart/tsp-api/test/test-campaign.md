# Campaign Test Suite

## Overview
Test suite for campaign-related functionality in the TSP API. Currently implemented as an empty test file, indicating either planned functionality or a placeholder for future campaign testing implementation.

## File Purpose
- **Primary Function**: Campaign functionality testing (placeholder)
- **Type**: Test suite file
- **Role**: Reserved for campaign management testing

## Current Implementation Status
The file currently exists but contains no implementation code. This suggests:
- **Future Implementation**: Planned campaign testing functionality
- **Development Phase**: Campaign features under development
- **Test Structure**: Placeholder for comprehensive campaign tests

## Expected Test Coverage

Based on typical campaign management systems, this test suite would likely cover:

### Campaign Lifecycle Testing
- Campaign creation and configuration
- Campaign activation and deactivation
- Campaign scheduling and time-based rules
- Campaign targeting and user segmentation

### Campaign Type Testing
- **Incentive Campaigns**: Reward-based user engagement
- **Challenge Campaigns**: Gamification and competition
- **Promotional Campaigns**: Marketing and user acquisition
- **Retention Campaigns**: User re-engagement strategies

### Campaign Integration Testing
- **Bingocard Integration**: Challenge card system
- **Reward System**: Points and coin distribution
- **User Labeling**: Campaign-based user categorization
- **Notification System**: Campaign-related messaging

## Potential Test Scenarios

### Campaign Management Tests
```javascript
describe('Campaign Management', () => {
  describe('Campaign Creation', () => {
    it('should create new campaign with valid data');
    it('should validate required campaign fields');
    it('should set campaign start and end times');
  });
  
  describe('Campaign Targeting', () => {
    it('should apply persona-based targeting');
    it('should filter by geographic regions');
    it('should handle user eligibility criteria');
  });
});
```

### Campaign Enrollment Tests
```javascript
describe('Campaign Enrollment', () => {
  it('should enroll eligible users automatically');
  it('should prevent duplicate enrollments');
  it('should handle enrollment capacity limits');
  it('should track enrollment timestamps');
});
```

### Campaign Rewards Tests
```javascript
describe('Campaign Rewards', () => {
  it('should distribute rewards upon completion');
  it('should validate reward eligibility');
  it('should handle different reward types');
  it('should track reward distribution history');
});
```

## Integration Points

### Database Models
- **Campaigns**: Campaign configuration and metadata
- **TokenCampaigns**: Token-based campaign mechanics
- **CMCampaigns**: Campaign management system
- **CMUserRecords**: User campaign participation records

### Service Dependencies
- **Bingocard Service**: Challenge card generation
- **Incentive Service**: Reward calculation and distribution
- **Notification Service**: Campaign communication
- **User Service**: Participant management

### External Systems
- **Admin Platform**: Campaign configuration interface
- **Analytics Service**: Campaign performance tracking
- **Reward System**: Points and coin management

## Test Framework Integration

### Expected Dependencies
```javascript
require('@maas/core/bootstrap');
const supertest = require('supertest');
const chai = require('chai');
const createApp = require('@maas/core/api');
const { getRouter } = require('@maas/core');

// Campaign-specific models
const Campaigns = require('@app/src/models/Campaigns');
const TokenCampaigns = require('@app/src/models/TokenCampaigns');
const CMUserRecords = require('@app/src/models/CMUserRecords');
```

### Test Configuration
```javascript
describe('Campaign System', () => {
  const testUserId = 1003;
  const auth = { userid: testUserId, 'Content-Type': 'application/json' };
  let app, router, request;
  
  before(async () => {
    app = createApp();
    router = getRouter();
    request = supertest.agent(app.listen());
  });
});
```

## API Endpoints (Expected)

### Campaign Information
- **GET /campaigns**: List available campaigns
- **GET /campaigns/{id}**: Get campaign details
- **GET /user/campaigns**: Get user's enrolled campaigns

### Campaign Participation
- **POST /campaigns/{id}/enroll**: Enroll in campaign
- **DELETE /campaigns/{id}/enroll**: Leave campaign
- **GET /campaigns/{id}/progress**: Check campaign progress

### Campaign Management
- **POST /campaigns**: Create new campaign (admin)
- **PUT /campaigns/{id}**: Update campaign (admin)
- **DELETE /campaigns/{id}**: Deactivate campaign (admin)

## Data Models (Expected)

### Campaign Configuration
```javascript
{
  id: number,
  title: string,
  description: string,
  reward_type: number,
  reward_amount: number,
  start_time: datetime,
  end_time: datetime,
  persona: string,
  gen_weight: string,
  available_activity: array,
  participants: array
}
```

### User Campaign Record
```javascript
{
  user_id: number,
  campaign_id: number,
  enrollment_date: datetime,
  completion_date: datetime,
  progress: object,
  rewards_earned: array
}
```

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing
- Campaign logic validation
- Enrollment rule testing
- Reward calculation testing
- Data validation testing

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end campaign flow
- Cross-service communication
- Database transaction testing
- External API integration

### Performance Testing
- Campaign enrollment scalability
- Reward distribution performance
- Database query optimization
- Concurrent user handling

## Error Scenarios

### Campaign Validation Errors
- Invalid campaign dates
- Missing required fields
- Conflicting campaign rules
- Invalid user targeting criteria

### Enrollment Errors
- Campaign not active
- User not eligible
- Enrollment capacity exceeded
- Duplicate enrollment attempts

### Reward Distribution Errors
- Insufficient reward balance
- Invalid reward configuration
- User account issues
- External service failures

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- User authentication for enrollment
- Admin authentication for management
- Campaign visibility restrictions
- Data privacy protection

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention
- Cross-site scripting protection
- Parameter validation

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Large user base enrollment
- Concurrent campaign participation
- Real-time progress tracking
- Batch reward processing

### Optimization
- Database indexing strategies
- Caching for campaign data
- Efficient user queries
- Background job processing

## Maintenance Notes

### Implementation Priority
- Campaign system appears to be planned feature
- Integration with existing bingocard system
- Coordination with reward and incentive systems
- User experience design considerations

### Development Approach
- Start with basic campaign CRUD operations
- Add enrollment and participation tracking
- Implement reward distribution
- Add advanced targeting and segmentation

### Future Enhancements
- **A/B Testing**: Campaign variant testing
- **Analytics**: Detailed campaign performance metrics
- **Automation**: Rule-based campaign triggers
- **Personalization**: AI-driven campaign recommendations
