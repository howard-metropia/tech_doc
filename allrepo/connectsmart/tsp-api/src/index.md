# TSP API Main Index Module

## Overview
The main index module for the TSP API source directory. This file serves as the primary entry point for the TSP API application logic and coordinates the initialization of core services.

## File Purpose
- **Primary Function**: Main application index and service coordinator
- **Type**: Core application module
- **Role**: Central entry point for TSP API functionality

## Current Implementation Status
The file currently exists but contains no implementation code. This suggests it may be:
- A placeholder for future implementation
- An entry point that delegates to other modules
- Part of a modular architecture where specific functionality is loaded dynamically

## Expected Functionality
Based on typical Node.js application patterns and the TSP API architecture, this file would likely include:

### Application Initialization
- Service bootstrapping and configuration
- Database connection establishment
- Middleware setup and routing configuration
- Error handling and logging initialization

### Module Coordination
- Importing and organizing core application modules
- Setting up service dependencies
- Coordinating startup sequence

### API Server Setup
- Express/Koa server configuration
- Route registration and middleware binding
- Port configuration and server startup

## Architecture Integration

### Role in TSP API Structure
- **Entry Point**: Primary module for application logic
- **Coordinator**: Manages relationships between services and modules
- **Bootstrapper**: Initializes core application components

### Integration with Other Components
- **Controllers**: Would typically register route handlers
- **Services**: Would initialize business logic services
- **Models**: Would establish database connections and model registration
- **Middlewares**: Would configure authentication, validation, and error handling

## Implementation Recommendations

### Core Structure
```javascript
// Typical implementation pattern
const app = require('./bootstraps');
const routes = require('./routes');
const services = require('./services');

// Initialize application
async function initialize() {
  await services.init();
  app.use(routes);
  return app;
}

module.exports = initialize;
```

### Service Integration
- Database connection management
- External service initialization
- Configuration loading and validation
- Health check endpoints

## Development Notes

### Current State
- File exists but is empty
- May be part of incremental development process
- Could be waiting for architecture decisions

### Future Implementation
- Should coordinate with `bootstraps.js` for application setup
- May integrate with MaaS core platform services
- Should establish consistent error handling patterns

## Dependencies (Expected)
Based on TSP API architecture:
- `./bootstraps`: Application bootstrap configuration
- `./services`: Business logic services
- `./controllers`: API route handlers
- `./middlewares`: Request processing middleware
- `@maas/core`: Core platform services

## Security Considerations
- Should implement proper authentication middleware
- Must establish secure database connections
- Should configure CORS and security headers
- Needs proper error handling to prevent information leakage

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient service initialization order
- Lazy loading of non-critical services
- Connection pooling for databases
- Proper resource cleanup on shutdown

## Monitoring and Logging
- Application startup logging
- Service health monitoring
- Error tracking and reporting
- Performance metrics collection

## Maintenance Notes
- Implementation pending - monitor for updates
- Should align with overall TSP API architecture
- May require coordination with MaaS core platform changes
- Consider implementing graceful shutdown handling
