# Test Documentation: Gift Cards API

## Overview
This test suite validates the Gift Cards functionality, which allows users to view available gift card redemption options within the TSP system. The test covers the retrieval of gift card categories and their associated redemption items with pricing and points information.

## Test Configuration
- **File**: `test/test-gift-cards.js`
- **Framework**: Mocha with Chai assertions and Supertest for HTTP testing
- **Test Timeout**: 10 seconds for gift card retrieval
- **Authentication**: User ID-based authentication (userid: 1003)
- **Scope**: Read-only API testing (no creation or modification)

## API Endpoints Tested

### 1. Get Gift Cards - `GET /giftcards`
**Purpose**: Retrieves all available gift card categories and redemption options

**Success Scenario**:
- Returns complete gift card catalog
- Includes categories with nested items
- Validates data structure and required fields
- Confirms at least one gift card category exists

**Response Structure**:
```javascript
{
  result: 'success',
  data: {
    giftcards: [
      {
        category_id: 1,
        name: 'Retail Gift Cards',
        image: 'https://example.com/category-image.jpg',
        items: [
          {
            id: 101,
            currency: 'USD',
            amount: 25.00,
            points: 2500,
            display_rate: '100 points = $1'
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Error Scenarios**:
- `10004`: Missing authentication header (userid required)

## Data Structure Validation

### Gift Card Categories
Each gift card category includes:
- `category_id`: Unique identifier for the category
- `name`: Display name of the gift card category
- `image`: URL or path to category image
- `items`: Array of available redemption items

### Gift Card Items
Each gift card item includes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the specific gift card
- `currency`: Currency code (e.g., 'USD', 'EUR')
- `amount`: Monetary value of the gift card
- `points`: Points required for redemption
- `display_rate`: User-friendly conversion rate display

## Business Logic

### Points-to-Currency Conversion
- Gift cards represent the primary redemption mechanism for user points
- Each item specifies the points cost and monetary value
- Display rate provides transparency for users
- Multiple currency support for international operations

### Category Organization
- Gift cards are organized by categories for better user experience
- Categories may include retail, dining, entertainment, etc.
- Visual organization with category images
- Hierarchical structure for easy navigation

### Redemption System
- Read-only API suggests redemption handled elsewhere
- Points balance validation likely occurs during redemption
- Gift card availability may be managed through admin systems
- Inventory tracking for limited-quantity items

## Authentication Requirements
- All gift card operations require user authentication
- User ID validation ensures personalized offerings
- Potential for user-specific gift card availability
- Points balance context for redemption decisions

## Error Handling
- **10004**: Standard authentication error for missing userid
- Robust error handling for API availability
- Graceful degradation when no gift cards available
- Consistent error response format

## Integration Points

### Points System Integration
- Gift cards serve as primary points redemption mechanism
- Requires integration with user points balance
- Conversion rates may be dynamic or configurable
- Transaction logging for redemption history

### Payment Processing
- Gift card redemption may involve external payment systems
- Currency conversion for international users
- Tax calculation for applicable jurisdictions
- Fraud prevention and security measures

### Inventory Management
- Gift card availability may be managed through admin systems
- Stock levels for limited-quantity items
- Automatic updates when items become unavailable
- Category management for seasonal offerings

## Test Coverage Analysis

### Positive Test Cases
- ✅ Retrieve gift card catalog successfully
- ✅ Validate response structure with required fields
- ✅ Confirm data integrity for categories and items
- ✅ Verify authentication requirement

### Negative Test Cases
- ✅ Authentication validation (missing userid)
- ✅ Error response format validation

### Data Validation
- ✅ Category structure validation
- ✅ Item structure validation
- ✅ Required field presence
- ✅ Data type validation

## Limitations and Considerations

### Read-Only Nature
- Test suite only covers retrieval functionality
- No tests for redemption process
- No user-specific filtering or personalization
- No inventory or availability testing

### Static Data Testing
- Gift card data appears to be static/seeded
- No dynamic inventory or pricing testing
- No real-time availability validation
- No user points balance integration

### Minimal Error Scenarios
- Limited error case coverage
- No testing for empty catalog
- No network failure simulation
- No malformed response handling

## Business Value

### User Experience
- Provides clear redemption options for earned points
- Visual category organization improves navigation
- Transparent pricing and conversion rates
- Multiple gift card options increase user satisfaction

### Revenue Generation
- Gift card partnerships may generate revenue
- Points system encourages user engagement
- Redemption tracking provides business insights
- Category management enables promotional campaigns

### Platform Integration
- Gift cards integrate with overall points economy
- Supports user retention through valuable rewards
- Provides tangible value for accumulated points
- Enables partnerships with retail and service providers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Test Additions
- User-specific gift card filtering
- Points balance validation integration

- Inventory availability testing
- Dynamic pricing validation
- Currency conversion testing

### Feature Expansion
- Personalized gift card recommendations
