# HntbBytemarkOrderPayments Model Documentation

## Overview
HntbBytemarkOrderPayments is a Knex.js-based model that manages HNTB (Houston North Transbay Connector) specific payment transaction records for Bytemark orders in the dataset MySQL database. This model is designed for research and analytical purposes related to transportation payment patterns.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class HntbBytemarkOrderPayments extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'hntb_bytemark_order_payments';
  }
}
module.exports = HntbBytemarkOrderPayments.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL (`dataset`)
- **Table**: `hntb_bytemark_order_payments`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql
- **Purpose**: Research and analytics data storage

## Core Functionality

### HNTB Research Data Management
- Stores payment transaction data for HNTB-specific studies
- Maintains research-grade data quality standards
- Supports longitudinal transportation payment analysis
- Enables policy impact assessment through payment patterns

### Dataset Integration
- Links to broader HNTB transportation research dataset
- Correlates payment data with trip patterns
- Supports multi-modal transportation analysis
- Enables behavioral economics research

## Usage Patterns

### Research Data Collection
```javascript
const HntbBytemarkOrderPayments = require('./HntbBytemarkOrderPayments');

// Store research payment data
const researchPayment = await HntbBytemarkOrderPayments.query().insert({
  study_id: studyId,
  participant_id: participantId,
  payment_amount: amount,
  payment_timestamp: timestamp,
  experiment_condition: condition
});

// Analyze payment patterns
const paymentAnalysis = await HntbBytemarkOrderPayments.query()
  .where('study_id', studyId)
  .groupBy('payment_method')
  .avg('payment_amount');
```
