# HntbRating Model Documentation

## Overview
HntbRating is a Knex.js-based model that manages user rating and satisfaction data for HNTB transportation research studies. This model collects and analyzes user feedback on transportation services, trip experiences, and system performance.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class HntbRating extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'hntb_rating';
  }
}
module.exports = HntbRating.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL (`dataset`)
- **Table**: `hntb_rating`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql

## Core Functionality

### Rating Collection Management
- Collects user satisfaction ratings for transportation services
- Manages multi-dimensional rating scales and categories
- Tracks rating trends over time and across user groups
- Supports qualitative and quantitative feedback collection

### Research Data Analysis
- Analyzes service quality patterns and trends
- Measures user satisfaction with different transportation modes
- Evaluates policy intervention effectiveness through ratings
- Supports comparative analysis across different conditions

## Usage Patterns

### Rating Data Collection
```javascript
const HntbRating = require('./HntbRating');

// Record user rating
const ratingRecord = await HntbRating.query().insert({
  participant_id: participantId,
  trip_id: tripId,
  service_type: 'public_transit',
  overall_rating: 4.2,
  comfort_rating: 4.0,
  timeliness_rating: 3.8,
  cost_rating: 4.5,
  rating_timestamp: new Date(),
  study_condition: 'control'
});

// Analyze service satisfaction
const satisfactionTrends = await HntbRating.query()
  .where('service_type', 'rideshare')
  .avg('overall_rating as avg_rating')
  .groupBy('rating_date');
```
