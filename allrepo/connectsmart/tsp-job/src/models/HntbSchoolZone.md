# HntbSchoolZone Model Documentation

## Overview
HntbSchoolZone is a Knex.js-based model that manages school zone geographic and temporal data for HNTB transportation research studies. This model supports safety analysis, traffic pattern studies, and policy research related to school transportation.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class HntbSchoolZone extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'hntb_school_zone';
  }
}
module.exports = HntbSchoolZone.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL (`dataset`)
- **Table**: `hntb_school_zone`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql

## Core Functionality

### School Zone Management
- Stores geographic boundaries of school zones
- Manages temporal restrictions and speed limits
- Tracks school calendar and activity schedules
- Supports safety enforcement and analysis

### Research Data Collection
- Analyzes traffic patterns around schools
- Studies transportation safety in school zones
- Evaluates policy intervention effectiveness
- Supports school transportation planning research

## Usage Patterns

### Zone Data Management
```javascript
const HntbSchoolZone = require('./HntbSchoolZone');

// Store school zone data
const schoolZone = await HntbSchoolZone.query().insert({
  school_id: schoolId,
  zone_name: 'Washington Elementary Zone',
  boundary_coordinates: JSON.stringify(coordinates),
  speed_limit_school_hours: 15, // mph
  speed_limit_normal: 25,       // mph
  active_hours_start: '07:00',
  active_hours_end: '16:00',
  school_calendar_start: '2024-08-15',
  school_calendar_end: '2024-06-10'
});

// Analyze zone violations
const violations = await HntbSchoolZone.query()
  .joinRelated('violations')
  .where('violation_type', 'speeding')
  .groupBy('school_id')
  .count('* as violation_count');
```

### Safety Analysis
- Traffic violation pattern analysis
- Speed compliance measurement
- Pedestrian safety assessment
- Temporal traffic variation studies

## School Zone Categories

### Elementary School Zones
- **Primary Education**: Ages 5-11 protection

### Middle School Zones
- **Adolescent Safety**: Ages 11-14 considerations
- **Bicycle Traffic**: Increased cycling activity
- **Parent Drop-off**: Vehicle congestion management
- **Activity Periods**: Sports and extracurricular timing

### High School Zones
- **Teen Drivers**: Student driver safety
- **Event Traffic**: Sports and activity congestion
- **Public Transit**: Bus route integration
- **Parking Management**: Student vehicle accommodation
