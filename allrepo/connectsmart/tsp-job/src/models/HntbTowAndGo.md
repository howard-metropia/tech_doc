# HntbTowAndGo Model Documentation

## Overview
HntbTowAndGo is a Knex.js-based model that manages tow-and-go service data for HNTB transportation research studies. This model tracks emergency vehicle assistance services, breakdown incidents, and service effectiveness for research purposes.

## Class Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('dataset');
class HntbTowAndGo extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'hntb_tow_and_go';
  }
}
module.exports = HntbTowAndGo.bindKnex(knex);
```

## Database Configuration
- **Database**: Dataset MySQL (`dataset`)
- **Table**: `hntb_tow_and_go`
- **ORM**: Knex.js with Model base class
- **Connection**: Managed through @maas/core/mysql

## Core Functionality

### Tow Service Management
- Tracks tow-and-go service requests and responses
- Manages incident location and service timing data
- Records service provider performance metrics
- Supports emergency assistance research analysis

### Research Data Collection
- Analyzes breakdown incident patterns
- Studies service response effectiveness
- Evaluates transportation resilience factors
- Measures impact on traffic flow and safety

## Usage Patterns

### Service Incident Recording
```javascript
const HntbTowAndGo = require('./HntbTowAndGo');

// Record tow service incident
const towIncident = await HntbTowAndGo.query().insert({
  incident_id: incidentId,
  participant_id: participantId,
  incident_location: JSON.stringify(coordinates),
  incident_timestamp: new Date(),
  service_request_time: requestTime,
  service_arrival_time: arrivalTime,
  service_completion_time: completionTime,
  incident_type: 'vehicle_breakdown',
  service_provider: 'AAA_Roadside',
  response_time_minutes: responseTimeMinutes
});

// Analyze service performance
const avgResponseTime = await HntbTowAndGo.query()
  .where('service_provider', providerId)
  .avg('response_time_minutes as avg_response');
```
