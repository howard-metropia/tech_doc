# TransitAlert Model

## Overview
Transit service alert management model for the TSP Job system. Handles public transportation alerts, service disruptions, and real-time transit notifications.

## Model Definition
```javascript
const knex = require('@maas/core/mysql')('gtfs');
class TransitAlert extends Model {
  static get tableName() {
    return 'ridemetro_transit_alert';
  }
  static get relationMappings() {
    const TransitAlertRoute = require('@app/src/models/TransitAlertRoute');
    return {
      route: {
        relation: Model.BelongsToOneRelation,
        modelClass: TransitAlertRoute,
        join: {
          from: 'ridemetro_transit_alert.event_id',
          to: 'ridemetro_transit_alert_join_route.event_id',
        },
      },
    };
  }
}
module.exports = TransitAlert.bindKnex(knex);
```
