üìã **Functionality Overview**
- **Non-technical explanation:** Like a master reference book that defines all the rules, timeouts, and reward types for the campaign system - similar to a game's rule book that specifies point values, time limits, and action types. Think of it as a settings file that determines how long notifications stay active, what types of campaigns exist, and how many points users earn for different activities, or a configuration manual that standardizes all campaign behavior across the system.
- **Technical explanation:** Constants definition module implementing configuration management pattern, providing centralized parameter storage for notification types, timeout values, and activity classification used throughout the campaign management system.
- **Business value:** Centralizes campaign configuration, enables easy modification of business rules, ensures consistency across system components, simplifies maintenance of timeout and point values.
- **System context:** Configuration layer for the ConnectSmart mobility platform's campaign system, providing shared constants used by notification handlers, point calculation systems, and campaign workflow engines.

üîß **Technical Specifications**
- **File info:** `define.py`, 26 lines, Constants module, Python, ~1KB, Complexity: Low (‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ)
- **Configuration categories:**
  - **NOTIFICATION_TYPE:** 7 notification type mappings (INFO, GO_EARLY, GO_LATER, CHANGE_MODE, WTA variants, MICROSURVEY, DUO)
  - **Expiration constants:** 6 timeout values in seconds (300-1800 range)
  - **POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE:** 5 point activity classifications (6-10 numeric range)

- **Point activity types:** Sequential numbering (6-10) for different engagement activities
- **Dependencies:** None (pure constants module)

üìù **Detailed Code Analysis**
- **Notification type mapping structure:**
  ```python
  NOTIFICATION_TYPE = {
    "INFO": 12,           # Information card delivery
    "GO_EARLY": 21,       # Early departure suggestion
    "GO_LATER": 13,       # Late departure suggestion  
    "CHANGE_MODE": 14,    # Transport mode change
    "WTA_GO_LATER": 24,   # WTA (Willing to Accept) late departure
    "WTA_GO_EARLY": 25,   # WTA early departure
    "WTA_CHANGE_MODE": 26,# WTA mode change
    "MICROSURVEY": 20,    # Interactive survey
    "DUO": 63            # Duo carpool matching
  }
  ```

- **Expiration time hierarchy:**
  ```python
  # Short-term interactions (5 minutes)
  MICROSURVEY_EXPIRATION_TIME = 300
  EXPIRATION_MESSAGE_QUEUE = 300
  EXPIRATION_DUO_NOTIFICATION = 300
  
  # Medium-term actions (30 minutes)
  EXPIRATION_GO_LATER = 1800
  EXPIRATION_GO_EARLY = 1800
  EXPIRATION_CHANGE_MODE = 1800
  ```

- **Points activity classification:**
  ```python
  POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_MICROSURVEY = 6   # Survey completion
  POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_GOLATER = 7       # Late departure action
  POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_CHANGEMODE = 8    # Mode change action
  POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_DUOCARPOOL = 9    # Carpool participation
  POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_GOEARLY = 10      # Early departure action
  ```

- **Design patterns:** Simple dictionary and constant definition pattern, no classes or functions
- **Memory footprint:** Minimal, constants loaded once at import time
- **Threading safety:** Read-only constants are inherently thread-safe

üöÄ **Usage Methods**
- **Import specific notification types:**
  ```python
  from campaign.define import NOTIFICATION_TYPE
  # Use in notification handler
  notification_id = NOTIFICATION_TYPE["GO_EARLY"]  # Returns 21
  send_notification(user_id, notification_id, message_data)
  ```

- **Access expiration times:**
  ```python
  from campaign.define import EXPIRATION_GO_EARLY, MICROSURVEY_EXPIRATION_TIME
  # Set notification expiration
  import time
  expiry_time = int(time.time()) + EXPIRATION_GO_EARLY  # 30 minutes from now
  queue_notification(notification, expiry_time)
  ```

- **Points system integration:**
  ```python
  from campaign.define import POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_MICROSURVEY
  # Record user activity with point type
  record_user_points(user_id, point_value, POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_MICROSURVEY)
  ```

- **Campaign handler integration:**
  ```python
  from campaign.define import NOTIFICATION_TYPE, EXPIRATION_CHANGE_MODE
  # Create mode change campaign
  def create_mode_change_campaign(user_id, message):
      return {
          "notification_type": NOTIFICATION_TYPE["CHANGE_MODE"],
          "expiration": EXPIRATION_CHANGE_MODE,
          "user_id": user_id,
          "message": message
      }
  ```

- **WTA campaign handling:**
  ```python
  from campaign.define import NOTIFICATION_TYPE
  # Handle WTA vs regular campaigns
  if is_wta_user:
      notif_type = NOTIFICATION_TYPE["WTA_GO_EARLY"]
  else:
      notif_type = NOTIFICATION_TYPE["GO_EARLY"]
  ```

üìä **Output Examples**
- **Notification type lookup:**
  ```python
  >>> from campaign.define import NOTIFICATION_TYPE
  >>> print(NOTIFICATION_TYPE["MICROSURVEY"])
  20
  >>> print(NOTIFICATION_TYPE["DUO"])
  63
  >>> print(list(NOTIFICATION_TYPE.keys()))
  ['INFO', 'GO_EARLY', 'GO_LATER', 'CHANGE_MODE', 'WTA_GO_LATER', 
   'WTA_GO_EARLY', 'WTA_CHANGE_MODE', 'MICROSURVEY', 'DUO']
  ```

- **Expiration time calculations:**
  ```python
  >>> from campaign.define import *
  >>> print(f"Microsurvey expires in {MICROSURVEY_EXPIRATION_TIME} seconds")
  Microsurvey expires in 300 seconds
  >>> print(f"Go Early expires in {EXPIRATION_GO_EARLY/60} minutes")
  Go Early expires in 30.0 minutes
  ```

- **Points activity mapping:**
  ```python
  >>> from campaign.define import *
  >>> activity_types = {
  ...     "microsurvey": POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_MICROSURVEY,
  ...     "go_later": POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_GOLATER,
  ...     "change_mode": POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_CHANGEMODE,
  ...     "duo_carpool": POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_DUOCARPOOL,
  ...     "go_early": POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE_GOEARLY
  ... }
  >>> print(activity_types)
  {'microsurvey': 6, 'go_later': 7, 'change_mode': 8, 'duo_carpool': 9, 'go_early': 10}
  ```

- **Configuration validation:**
  ```python
  >>> # Validate notification type exists
  >>> campaign_type = "INVALID_TYPE"
  >>> if campaign_type in NOTIFICATION_TYPE:
  ...     print(f"Valid type: {NOTIFICATION_TYPE[campaign_type]}")
  ... else:
  ...     print(f"Invalid campaign type: {campaign_type}")
  Invalid campaign type: INVALID_TYPE
  ```

- **Timeout comparison:**
  ```python
  >>> from campaign.define import *
  >>> timeouts = [
  ...     ("Microsurvey", MICROSURVEY_EXPIRATION_TIME),
  ...     ("Go Early", EXPIRATION_GO_EARLY),
  ...     ("Change Mode", EXPIRATION_CHANGE_MODE),
  ...     ("Duo Notification", EXPIRATION_DUO_NOTIFICATION)
  ... ]
  >>> for name, timeout in sorted(timeouts, key=lambda x: x[1]):
  ...     print(f"{name}: {timeout}s ({timeout/60}min)")
  Microsurvey: 300s (5.0min)
  Duo Notification: 300s (5.0min)
  Go Early: 1800s (30.0min)
  Change Mode: 1800s (30.0min)
  ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- **Security considerations:**
  - Constants are read-only and pose no direct security risk
  - Validate notification types before using in database queries
  - Ensure timeout values don't allow indefinite message queuing
  - Consider rate limiting based on notification types

- **Configuration management:**
  - Changes to these constants affect all campaign functionality immediately
  - Test thoroughly before modifying expiration times in production
  - Document any changes to notification type mappings
  - Consider environment-specific overrides for different deployment stages

- **Common troubleshooting:**
  - **KeyError on notification type:** Verify the key exists in NOTIFICATION_TYPE dictionary
  - **Unexpected timeout behavior:** Check if expiration constants match business requirements
  - **Point calculation issues:** Ensure POINTS_ACTIVITY_TYPE values are unique and sequential
  - **Import errors:** Verify the define module is in the correct path and accessible

- **Performance considerations:**
  - Constants are loaded once at import time - no runtime performance impact
  - Dictionary lookups are O(1) operations
  - Consider caching if these values are accessed very frequently

- **Breaking changes:**
  - Changing notification type values breaks existing database records
  - Modifying expiration times affects active campaigns
  - Point activity type changes impact historical reporting
