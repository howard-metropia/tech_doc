📋 **Functionality Overview**
- **Non-technical explanation:** Like a smart environmental rewards calculator that determines fair incentive payments based on how far you traveled and what transportation method you used - it's similar to how a fitness app calculates calories burned based on activity type and distance, or how airline miles are awarded based on flight distance and class of service.
- **Technical explanation:** Mathematical incentive engine implementing gamma distribution algorithms for reward calculation, integrated with multiple mapping APIs for precise distance validation, supporting multi-modal transportation analysis.
- **Business value:** Enables fair and transparent sustainability incentive programs, reduces fraud through distance verification, and supports corporate environmental goals with data-driven reward systems.
- **System context:** Core component of ConnectSmart's sustainability platform, integrating with trip tracking, enterprise programs, and telework management systems.

⚠️ **Important Notes**
- **Gamma distribution fairness:** Uses mathematically sound gamma distribution to ensure fair reward randomization without predictable patterns
- **API dependency risk:** Distance validation depends on external APIs - implement monitoring for service availability
- **Distance calculation hierarchy:** HERE Maps preferred for European routes, Google Maps for global coverage, linear distance as final fallback
- **Minimum distance threshold:** 10-meter threshold prevents unnecessary API calls for very short trips
- **First trip incentive:** Fixed 0.99 reward encourages initial user engagement
- **Database consistency:** Trip distance recalculation updates both trip and telework_log tables simultaneously
- **Travel mode mapping:** Internal travel codes mapped to API-compatible strings for consistency
- **Reward boundaries:** Gamma distribution results capped at configured minimum/maximum values
