üìã **Functionality Overview**
- **Non-technical explanation:** Like a digital filing cabinet that lives in a single file - SQLite stores your entire database in one file on your computer, making it perfect for small applications, development work, or situations where you don't want to set up a separate database server.
- **Technical explanation:** Embedded database adapter that provides full SQL capabilities through SQLite's file-based storage engine, offering ACID transactions, SQL compliance, and zero-configuration deployment.
- Business value: Enables rapid development and deployment without database server setup, reduces infrastructure complexity, and provides reliable embedded storage for applications.
- Context: Ideal for development, testing, small applications, and embedded systems where simplicity and portability are more important than scalability.

üîß **Technical Specifications**
- File: `pydal/adapters/sqlite.py` (8KB+, Complexity: Medium)
- SQLite versions: 3.x with full SQL compliance
- Driver: Built-in Python sqlite3 module (no additional installation)
- Storage: Single file database or in-memory operation
- Connection URI: `sqlite://path/to/database.db` or `sqlite://memory`
- Limitations: No concurrent writes, limited scalability, single-file storage
- Features: Full SQL support, triggers, views, foreign keys, JSON1 extension

üìù **Detailed Code Analysis**
- **SQLite class**: Extends SQLAdapter with SQLite-specific optimizations
- **File-based storage**: Database stored in single .db file
- **In-memory option**: RAM-based database for testing and temporary storage
- **Connection management**: Automatic file creation and connection handling
- **SQLite-specific features**:
  - Automatic primary key handling
  - PRAGMA statements for configuration
  - Efficient small-scale operations
  - Built-in full-text search (FTS)
- **Query optimizations**: SQLite-specific SQL generation and indexing
- **Transaction handling**: ACID compliance with file-level locking

üöÄ **Usage Methods**
- File-based SQLite database:
```python
from pydal import DAL
# Create file-based database
db = DAL('sqlite://storage.db')
db.define_table('users', Field('name'), Field('email'))
```
- In-memory database for testing:
```python
# Memory-only database (faster, temporary)
db = DAL('sqlite://memory')
db.define_table('test_data', Field('value'))
```
- SQLite-specific optimizations:
```python
# Configure SQLite pragmas
db.executesql('PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL')
db.executesql('PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL')
db.executesql('PRAGMA cache_size=-64000')  # 64MB cache
```
- Backup and restore:
```python
# Backup database
import shutil
shutil.copy('storage.db', 'backup.db')

# Or use SQLite backup API
db.executesql('.backup backup.db')
```

üìä **Output Examples**
- Database creation and connection:
```python
>>> db = DAL('sqlite://test.db')
>>> db._adapter.dbengine
'sqlite'
>>> db._adapter.driver_name
'sqlite3'
>>> os.path.exists('test.db')
True
```
- In-memory database:
```python
>>> db = DAL('sqlite://memory')
>>> db.define_table('temp', Field('data'))
>>> db.temp.insert(data='test')
1
>>> len(db().select(db.temp.ALL))
1
```
- SQLite-specific information:
```python
>>> db.executesql('SELECT sqlite_version()')
[('3.36.0',)]
>>> db.executesql('PRAGMA table_info(users)')
[(0, 'id', 'INTEGER', 0, None, 1), (1, 'name', 'CHAR(512)', 0, None, 0), ...]
```
- Performance characteristics:
```python
>>> import time
>>> start = time.time()
>>> for i in range(1000):
...     db.users.insert(name=f'User{i}')
>>> print(f'1000 inserts: {time.time() - start:.2f}s')
1000 inserts: 0.15s
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**
- Concurrency limitations: Only one writer at a time, multiple readers allowed
- File locking: Database file is locked during write operations
- Scalability: Not suitable for high-concurrency or large-scale applications
- Performance: Excellent for small to medium datasets, degrades with very large data
- Thread safety: SQLite is thread-safe but connections are not shareable
- File system: Database file must be on writable file system
- Backup: Simple file copy works for backup when database is not in use
- Memory usage: In-memory databases lost when connection closes
