# test_rocket.py

## Overview
This file contains a placeholder for Rocket web server tests. The file indicates that the testing approach should use external tools like pathoc for HTTP testing rather than implementing custom tests within the web2py framework.

## Purpose
- Placeholder for Rocket web server testing
- Documents recommended testing approach using external tools
- References integration with pathoc (HTTP testing tool)
- Suggests automated integration with gluon/tests framework

## Content

### TODO Comment
```python
# TODO : I think we should continue to use pathoc (http://pathod.net/docs/pathoc) for tests but integrate the call in
#        gluon/tests so they run automatically. No need to make our own tests.

## Recommended Testing Approach

### External Testing Tools
- **pathoc**: HTTP client for testing web servers
- **pathod**: HTTP daemon for testing HTTP clients
- **Integration**: Automatic execution within gluon/tests framework
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive HTTP server testing

### Rocket Web Server
Rocket is the default WSGI server included with web2py for development and small deployments.

**Features to Test:**
- **HTTP Protocol**: HTTP/1.1 compliance and features
- **WSGI Interface**: WSGI specification compliance
- **Performance**: Request handling performance
- **Concurrency**: Multiple request handling
- **Error Handling**: Proper error responses
- **Static Files**: Static file serving capabilities

### Testing Strategy
Rather than custom tests, the recommended approach is:

1. **External Tool Integration**: Use proven HTTP testing tools
2. **Automated Execution**: Integrate with existing test framework
3. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Leverage tool capabilities for thorough testing
4. **Maintenance**: Reduce custom test maintenance overhead

## Integration Requirements

### pathoc Integration
- **Installation**: pathoc tool availability
- **Configuration**: Test server configuration
- **Execution**: Automated test execution
- **Reporting**: Integration with unittest reporting

### Test Categories
- **Basic HTTP**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE methods
- **Headers**: Request and response header handling
- **Status Codes**: Proper HTTP status code responses
- **Content Types**: Various content type handling
- **Encoding**: Character encoding support
- **Performance**: Load and stress testing

## Usage Example
```bash
# Manual pathoc testing (future integration)
pathoc localhost:8000

# Example test commands
get:/
get:/admin
post:/submit
```

## Integration with web2py Framework

### Development Server
- **Default Server**: Rocket serves as development server
- **Testing Environment**: Local testing and development
- **Debug Mode**: Development-friendly error reporting
- **Hot Reload**: Code change detection and reloading

### Production Considerations
- **Scalability**: Limited scalability for high-traffic sites
- **Performance**: Adequate for small to medium applications
- **Alternatives**: Apache, Nginx, Gunicorn for production
- **Configuration**: Server configuration and tuning

## Future Implementation

### Test Integration Plan
1. **Tool Selection**: Finalize pathoc or alternative HTTP testing tool
2. **Framework Integration**: Integrate with gluon/tests execution
3. **Test Definition**: Define comprehensive test scenarios
4. **Automation**: Automated test execution and reporting
5. **CI/CD**: Continuous integration with HTTP server tests

### Test Scenarios
- **Basic Functionality**: Core HTTP server operations
- **Error Conditions**: Error handling and recovery
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing
- **Security Tests**: Security vulnerability testing
- **Compatibility**: Browser and client compatibility
