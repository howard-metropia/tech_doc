## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Find Payments Endpoint (`GET /wallet/payments`)

**Purpose:** Retrieves user's payment history and transaction records

**Flow:**
1. **Authentication:** JWT validation via auth middleware
2. **User Context:** Extracts userId from request headers
3. **Payment Retrieval:** Calls getPayment service with user context
4. **Response:** Returns payment history in standardized format

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const response = await getPayment({
  ctx,
  user_id: ctx.request.headers.userid,
});
ctx.body = success({
  payments: response,
});
```

### Find Tickets Endpoint (`GET /tickets/search`)

**Purpose:** Searches available ticket products based on specified criteria

**Flow:**
1. **Authentication:** JWT validation required
2. **Query Parsing:** Extracts search type from query parameters
3. **Product Search:** Delegates to searchProduct service
4. **Response:** Returns filtered ticket list

**Search Parameters:**
```javascript
const type = ctx.request.query.type;
const response = await searchProduct({
  ctx,
  searchType: type,
  user_id: ctx.request.header.userid,
});
```

### Pay Tickets Endpoint (`POST /tickets/pay`)

**Purpose:** Processes ticket purchase payments
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **CURRENTLY DISABLED** - Returns error immediately

**Intended Flow (when enabled):**
1. **Authentication:** JWT validation required
2. **User Verification:** Checks if user is blocked (for free payments)
3. **Payment Processing:** Constructs payment bean with all required data
4. **Transaction:** Processes payment through payTicket service
5. **Response:** Returns payment confirmation or detailed error

**Payment Bean Structure:**
```javascript
const bean = {
  payment_id: ctx.request.body.payment_id,
  payment_type: ctx.request.body.payment_type,
  items: ctx.request.body.items,
  user_id: userId,
  zone: ctx.request.headers.zone || 'America/Chicago',
  ctx: ctx
};
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Payment Endpoint Status
- **Currently Disabled:** The pay_tickets endpoint immediately throws an error
- **Error Code Mismatch:** Returns `ERROR_UBER_DETAIL` instead of ticket-related error
- **Commented Code:** Implementation exists but is unreachable due to immediate error
- **Activation Required:** Endpoint needs error removal to become functional

### Error Handling Strategy
The controller implements sophisticated error handling with specific error codes:
- `ERROR_TRANSIT_TICKET_TRANSACTION`: Transaction processing failures
- `ERROR_TRANSIT_TICKET_PAYMENT`: Payment method issues
- `ERROR_USER_COIN_SUSPENDED`: User account restrictions
- `ERROR_REDEEM_DAILY_LIMIT`: Daily transaction limits exceeded
- `ERROR_TRANSIT_TICKET_SYSTEM`: General system errors

### User Verification
- **Blocked User Check:** Applied only for payment_id = 0 (free tickets)
- **Authentication Required:** All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
- **User Context:** userId extracted from headers for all operations

### Timezone Support
- **Default Zone:** 'America/Chicago' if not specified
- **Header Override:** Timezone can be set via 'zone' header
- **Payment Processing:** Timezone affects transaction timestamps

### Commented Features
The code contains commented endpoints that suggest additional functionality:
- `find_park_ride_tickets`: Park and ride ticket search
- `pass_use`: Ticket usage/activation

These may represent future features or deprecated functionality.

### Payment Types
Based on the payment processing logic, the system supports:
- Credit card payments
- Wallet-based payments
- Free ticket redemption (with user verification)
- Multiple item purchases in single transaction
