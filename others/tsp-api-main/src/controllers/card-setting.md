# Card Setting Controller Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This controller provides a full suite of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user-defined "cards" or "widgets" that appear within the application's user interface.

**Keywords:** card-setting | widget-management | ui-customization | dashboard-cards | user-preferences | crud-api | tsp-api | koa-router | user-interface

**Primary use cases:**

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this controller as the **manager of your phone's home screen**. It allows you to see which app icons (cards) are currently displayed (`GET`), add a new app icon (`POST`), move an icon to a different spot or resize it (`PUT`), and drag an icon to the trash bin to remove it (`DELETE`). It gives users complete control over the layout and content of their personal dashboard within the application.

**Technical explanation:** 
A standard Koa.js REST controller that exposes a resource-oriented API for "card setting" entities. It implements all four CRUD verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) on the `/api/v1/card_setting` route prefix. All operations are authenticated via JWT middleware. The controller's primary responsibilities are to enforce authentication, validate incoming request data against Joi schemas, extract user context from headers, and delegate the core business logic (database interactions) to the corresponding functions in the `card-setting` service layer.

**Business value explanation:**
This controller is fundamental to providing a customizable and personalized user experience. By allowing users to control the information and tools they see first, it increases user engagement and satisfaction. It enables the platform to offer a wide variety of informational widgets or tools (e.g., weather, traffic, transit status, points balance) and lets the user decide which are most important to them, making the application more relevant and "sticky".

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

This controller follows a consistent and clean pattern for each of its four endpoints.

**General Pattern:**
1.  **Route Definition**: A route is defined for each HTTP method (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`) on the base path `/`.
2.  **Middleware Chain**: Each route uses the `auth` middleware for authentication and `bodyParser` to handle request payloads.
3.  **Input Validation**: `inputValidator` is used with the corresponding schema (`get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) to validate a combination of data from the request headers, body, and query parameters. This is a critical security and data integrity step.
4.  **Service Delegation**: The validated input is passed to the corresponding function in the `services.card-setting` module (e.g., `services.get(userId)`). The controller awaits the result.
5.  **Response**: The result from the service layer is wrapped in a standard `success` response object and sent back to the client.

### Endpoint Breakdown

#### `GET /`
- **Purpose**: Retrieve all card settings for the authenticated user.
- **Input**: `userId` extracted from the request header.
- **Service Call**: `services.get(userId)`
- **Output**: An object or array representing the user's card settings.

#### `POST /`
- **Purpose**: Create a new card setting for the user.
- **Input**: A combination of user data from the header and card data from the request body.
- **Service Call**: `services.create(input)`
- **Output**: The newly created card setting object.

#### `PUT /`
- **Purpose**: Update an existing card setting.
- **Input**: User data from headers, update data from the body, and likely an identifier (e.g., `card_id`) from the query string to specify which card to update.
- **Service Call**: `services.update(input)`
- **Output**: The updated card setting object.

#### `DELETE /`
- **Purpose**: Remove a card setting.
- **Input**: User data from headers and an identifier from the body or query string.
- **Service Call**: `services.delete(input)`
- **Output**: A confirmation of the deletion, often the deleted object or a status object.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

**Base URL:** `https://api.tsp.example.com/api/v1/card_setting`

  -d '{
    "card_type": "weather",
    "position": 1,
    "settings": { "zip_code": "77002" }

```

### Update an Existing Card
```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.tsp.example.com/api/v1/card_setting?card_id=card_abc" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "position": 2
  }'

## üìä Output Examples

### Successful GET Response
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "data": {
    "cards": [
      { "card_id": "card_xyz", "card_type": "points_balance", "position": 0 },
      { "card_id": "card_abc", "card_type": "weather", "position": 1, "settings": { "zip_code": "77002" } }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Successful POST/PUT Response
```json
{
  "result": "success",
  "data": {
    "card_id": "card_new_123",
    "card_type": "weather",
    "position": 1,
    "settings": { "zip_code": "77002" }
  }
}
```

### Validation Error Response (400)
If required data is missing from a `POST` request:
```json
{
    "error": "ERROR_BAD_REQUEST_BODY",
    "message": "\"card_type\" is required",
    "code": 400
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **User-Centric**: All operations are implicitly tied to the authenticated user whose ID is passed in the request headers. The service layer is responsible for ensuring a user can only affect their own settings.
- **Schema is Key**: The exact fields required for `create` and `update` are defined in the `card-setting` Joi schema file. This is the source of truth for the API contract.
- **Stateless**: The controller is stateless and relies entirely on the `auth` middleware and the data passed in each request.
