## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this as a weather machine for testing - like a movie studio creating fake rain or snow for filming. Just as filmmakers need controlled weather conditions to test scenes, developers need controlled weather data to test how their transportation app behaves during storms, snow, or extreme heat. This controller acts like a weather remote control, letting developers create, modify, and remove fake weather events at will.

**Technical explanation:**
RESTful controller providing CRUD operations for mock weather alerts and forecasts. Implements environment-gated access with configuration-driven availability, using Koa.js routing patterns with validation middleware and standardized response formatting.

**Business value:** Enables comprehensive testing of weather-dependent transportation features without relying on unpredictable real weather conditions, reducing testing costs and improving feature reliability.

**System context:** Part of TSP API's testing infrastructure, supporting quality assurance for weather-sensitive mobility services like route planning, alert notifications, and service disruption management.

## üîß Technical Specifications

**File Information:**
- Path: `/src/controllers/mockWeatherEvents.js`
- Language: JavaScript (Node.js)
- Type: Koa.js Router Controller
- Size: ~4KB
- Complexity: Medium (conditional routing, CRUD operations)

**Dependencies:**
- `@koa/router` (^12.0.0) - HTTP routing framework
- `@maas/core/response` (custom) - Standardized API responses
- `koa-bodyparser` (^4.3.0) - Request body parsing middleware
- `config` (^3.3.8) - Configuration management

**Environment Control:**
- Disabled in production unless `weather.mockAllowed = 'true'`
- Requires `portal.projectStage !== 'production'` OR debug mode enabled
- Routes only registered when conditions met

**Security Requirements:**
- Standard TSP API authentication (JWT tokens)
- Environment-based access control
- Input validation via Joi schemas

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

**Main Router Configuration:**
```javascript
const router = new Router({ prefix: '/api/v2' });
// Environment check gates all route registration
if (stage !== 'production' || isDebugModeEnabled) {
  // Routes only registered if conditions met
}
```

**CRUD Operation Pattern:**
Each endpoint follows standardized pattern:
1. Input validation via schema
2. Service layer call
3. Conditional success/error response
4. Consistent error handling with MaasError

**Error Handling Mechanism:**
- Success responses: `success()` wrapper with data
- Client errors: `fail()` with 400 status
- Not found: `MaasError(404)` with descriptive messages
- Validation errors: Automatic Joi validation rejection

**Performance Characteristics:**
- Synchronous route registration (startup time)
- Async/await pattern for all operations
- No caching layer (testing data)

## üöÄ Usage Methods

**Create Weather Alert:**
```bash
POST /api/v2/mock-weather/alert
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>

{
  "title": "Severe Thunderstorm Warning",
  "description": "Heavy rain and lightning expected",
  "severity": "severe",
  "gridId": "ABC123",
  "startTime": "2024-01-15T14:00:00Z",
  "endTime": "2024-01-15T18:00:00Z"
}
```

**Get Alert by ID:**
```bash
GET /api/v2/mock-weather/alert/123
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

**Update Existing Alert:**
```bash
PUT /api/v2/mock-weather/alert/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "severity": "moderate",
  "description": "Updated conditions"
}
```

**Find Weather Grid:**
```bash
GET /api/v2/mock-weather/grid?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0060
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

**Update Forecast:**
```bash
PUT /api/v2/mock-weather/forecast/456
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "temperature": 75,
  "conditions": "partly_cloudy",
  "precipitation": 0.1
}
```

## üìä Output Examples

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "message": "ok",
    "id": "alert_123456"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Alert Retrieval Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": "alert_123456",
    "title": "Severe Thunderstorm Warning",
    "severity": "severe",
    "gridId": "ABC123",
    "active": true,
    "createdAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
```json
// 404 Not Found
{
  "status": "error",
  "code": 404,
  "message": "alert not found",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:35:00Z"
}

  "status": "error",
  "code": 400,
  "message": "failed to create mock-alert"
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Environment Restrictions:**
- Automatically disabled in production environments
- Override with `weather.mockAllowed = 'true'` config
- Routes return 404 if not available

**Common Troubleshooting:**
- **404 on all endpoints:** Check environment stage and mockAllowed config
- **Validation errors:** Verify request body matches schema requirements
- **Alert not found:** Confirm alert ID exists and hasn't been deleted
- **Grid lookup fails:** Verify coordinates are within supported regions

**Security Considerations:**
- Only available in non-production environments by design
- Standard API authentication still required
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- No sensitive data exposure in mock responses

**Performance Notes:**
- No rate limiting on mock endpoints
- Memory-based storage (data not persistent)
- Suitable for testing volumes only
