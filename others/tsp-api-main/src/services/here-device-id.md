# HERE Device ID Logging Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This is a simple, single-purpose service designed to be a **data sink for device information**. Its sole function is to receive a payload of device-specific details from a client application and insert it as a new record into the `UserDeviceLog` database table. The most important piece of data it logs is the `here_device_id`, which is essential for linking an application user to their device's identity within the HERE Maps platform.

**Keywords:** device-log | here-maps | data-sink | logging | user-device | analytics

**Primary use cases:** 
- To log the device characteristics and unique identifiers for a given user.
- To create a permanent record associating a user's account with their HERE Maps device ID.
- To collect data for debugging, analytics, and ensuring proper functionality of HERE-integrated features.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What does this service do?** ‚Üí It takes device information (like model, OS version, and HERE Device ID) and saves it to a database table.
- **Q: Why is the `here_device_id` important?** ‚Üí It's a unique identifier used by the HERE Maps platform. Logging it allows the backend to associate our user with their activity and data within HERE's systems, which is crucial for location-based services and tracking.
- **Q: Is there any logic in this service?** ‚Üí No. It's a straightforward "data in, data out" service. It performs a direct database `INSERT` without any validation (beyond what the database schema enforces) or data transformation.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as a **librarian creating a new library card for a patron's computer**.
1.  **You Provide Your Details:** You go to the librarian and provide the details of the computer you want to register: "This is my user ID, it's a MacBook Pro, the operating system is macOS Sonoma, and here is its unique HERE Maps ID number."
2.  **The Librarian Records the Information:** The librarian takes this information and writes it down verbatim on a new index card (`UserDeviceLog` record).
3.  **The Card is Filed:** The librarian files the index card away for future reference.
The service does nothing more than receive and record this information without any judgment or modification.

**Technical explanation:** 
The service exports a single async function, `logDeviceInfo`. This function accepts a destructured object containing `userId`, `here_device_id`, and other device-related fields. It then directly calls `UserDeviceLog.query().insert()` with this data, which uses an Objection.js model to insert a new row into the corresponding database table. It includes basic `try...catch` block for logging any potential database errors but does not contain any other business logic. The inserted record is returned upon success.

**Business value explanation:**
This service provides essential data for both technical operations and business analytics. From a technical standpoint, having a detailed log of user devices is invaluable for debugging user-specific issues. If a user reports a bug, support teams can look up their device information to see if the problem is correlated with a specific OS or app version. From a business analytics perspective, this data helps build a profile of the user base (e.g., "70% of our users are on iOS 15 or newer"), which can inform product decisions and development priorities. It is also a foundational requirement for any feature that relies on HERE's location and tracking services.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
const hereDeviceLogger = require('@app/src/services/here-device-id');

// Example: When the app starts up or a user logs in, send device info to the backend.
async function sendDeviceInformation(currentUser, hereSDK) {
    try {
        const deviceInfo = {
            userId: currentUser.id,
            here_device_id: await hereSDK.getDeviceId(), // Get ID from HERE SDK
            platform: 'iOS',
            device_model: 'iPhone14,5',
            platform_device_id: 'ABC-123-DEF-456', // e.g., IDFA
            os_version: '15.4.1',
            app_version: '2.3.0'
        };

        // Call the service to log this information
        const logResult = await hereDeviceLogger.logDeviceInfo(deviceInfo);
        
        console.log('Successfully logged device info with ID:', logResult.id);

    } catch (error) {
        // The service logs the error on the backend, but we can also handle it here.
        console.error('Failed to log device info:', error.message);
    }
}
```
