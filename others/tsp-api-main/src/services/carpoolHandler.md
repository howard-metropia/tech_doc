# Carpool & Escrow Logic Handler Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This is a highly complex and critical service that orchestrates the entire business logic for the carpooling (Duo) feature. It manages everything from finding conflicting user reservations to handling the intricate financial settlements between riders and drivers via a sophisticated escrow system. The service is the single source of truth for carpool state management, calculating trip costs, processing cancellations and rejections, and ensuring the correct transfer of funds or points upon trip completion. **This is one of the most complex services in the application, and changes should be made with extreme caution.**

**Keywords:** carpool | duo | escrow | payment | transaction | reservation | business-logic

**Primary use cases:** 
- Checking for and preventing conflicting/overlapping user trips.
- Finding matched carpool partners for a given reservation.
- Calculating the price of a carpool trip based on distance and driver-set unit prices.
- Managing the entire lifecycle of an escrow payment: holding funds, refunding a rider on cancellation/rejection, and paying out the driver and platform fees on successful completion.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Knex.js.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What is this service for?** ‚Üí It runs the entire carpooling feature, especially the money part.
- **Q: What is "escrow"?** ‚Üí It's a temporary holding account for money. When a rider agrees to a carpool, their payment goes into escrow. This service then decides where the money goes next: to the driver (if the trip is successful), back to the rider (if it's cancelled), or a mix of both.
- **Q: Is this service simple?** ‚Üí No. It is extremely complex. It handles many different "what if" scenarios (what if the driver cancels? what if the rider rejects? etc.), and each one has different financial rules.
- **Q: What is ERH?** ‚Üí It appears to be "Emergency Ride Home," a related program. The service has logic to handle a "premium" associated with ERH, likely refunding it if a carpool fails.

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as the **combination of a meticulous travel agent, an escrow lawyer, and an accountant, all dedicated to a carpooling platform**.
1.  **The Travel Agent (`getConflictingReservations`):** Before booking a carpool, a user calls the agent. The agent checks all the user's other travel plans (bus trips, solo drives, other carpools) to make sure their new carpool doesn't overlap.
2.  **The Escrow Lawyer (`rejectInviteEscrowProcess`, `cancelCarpoolEscrowReturn`, etc.):** When a rider and driver match, the rider's payment is given to the lawyer to hold in a secure briefcase (the escrow account). The lawyer has a thick rulebook for every possible outcome:
    -   If the driver cancels, the lawyer returns the full amount to the rider.
    -   If the rider cancels, the lawyer might have to give a small cancellation fee to the driver and return the rest.
    -   If the trip happens successfully, the lawyer proceeds to the final step.
3.  **The Accountant (`transferCarpoolFeeDriver`):** After the lawyer confirms a successful trip, the accountant opens the briefcase. They pay the driver for their service, take out a small platform fee for the company, and close the books on the transaction.

**Technical explanation:** 
This service is a state machine and transaction handler for carpool reservations, using a MySQL database via `knex`. It manages the `reservation` and `duo_reservation` tables for state, and the `escrow` and `escrow_detail` tables for financial transactions.
-   **Conflict Detection:** `getConflictingReservations` queries a user's `reservation` table to find any existing trips with a `RESERVED` or `MATCHED` status that have an overlapping time window with a proposed new trip.
-   **Escrow Management:** The core of the service is a set of functions that manage the escrow process. `cancelCarpoolEscrowReturn` and `rejectInviteEscrowProcess` contain byzantine logic to handle financial settlements for various failure scenarios, calculating how much to refund to a rider's wallet and how much, if any, to transfer as a fee. They do this by logging counter-transactions in the `escrow_detail` table.
-   **Successful Payout:** `transferCarpoolFeeDriver` is the "happy path" function that executes after a successful trip. It orchestrates the entire payout: it calls the `walletService` to execute a `pointsTransaction` from the platform's escrow account to the driver's wallet, logs the details, and formally closes the escrow record.
-   **Helpers:** Numerous helper functions like `calculateTotalPriceByUnitPrice`, `addEscrowDetail`, and `findPairedReservation` encapsulate smaller, reusable pieces of the complex logic.

**Business value explanation:**
This service is the engine that makes the carpooling feature a viable and trustworthy product. By implementing a robust escrow system, it protects both riders and drivers, ensuring that payments are handled fairly and transparently according to a clear set of rules. The logic within this service directly enables monetization through transaction fees and is fundamental to the integrity and reliability of the entire carpool ecosystem. Its correctness is paramount to user trust and the financial health of the feature.

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### State-Driven Complexity
The primary source of complexity is the sheer number of states and events the system must handle. A carpool can be `SEARCHING`, `MATCHED`, `STARTED`, `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED_BY_RIDER`, `CANCELLED_BY_DRIVER`, `REJECTED`, etc. Each state transition, especially those involving cancellations, triggers a different path through the complex escrow logic in this service.

### Financial Calculations
The service is replete with financial calculations. It determines trip prices based on distance and unit price, calculates platform fees based on configuration, and processes refunds. The use of `Math.round(val * 100) / 100` suggests it is carefully handling floating-point arithmetic for currency, which is a good practice. However, using a dedicated library like `Decimal.js` would be even safer to avoid floating-point inaccuracies entirely.

### Database Transactions
The functions in this service perform multiple, sequential `knex` calls to `select`, `update`, and `insert` data. Given the financial nature of these operations, they are prime candidates for being wrapped in explicit database transactions (e.g., `knex.transaction(async (trx) => { ... })`). Without them, a failure midway through a function (e.g., in `transferCarpoolFeeDriver` after the escrow is closed but before the driver is paid) could leave the database in an inconsistent and incorrect state. The current implementation appears to lack these explicit transactions, which is a significant risk.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
// This service is not called directly by controllers, but by other services or jobs
// that manage the lifecycle of a carpool trip.

// Example: In a job that runs after a trip is confirmed as complete
const carpoolHandler = require('@app/src/services/carpoolHandler');

async function processCompletedTrip(trip) {
  const driver = trip.driver;
  const rider = trip.rider;
  
  try {
    // This single call will handle the entire financial settlement.
    await carpoolHandler.transferCarpoolFeeDriver(
      driver.id,
      rider.id,
      trip.id,
      trip.driverTransactionFee,
      trip.passengerTransactionFee
    );
    console.log(`Successfully processed payment for trip ${trip.id}`);
  } catch (error) {
    // Alerting and manual intervention would be critical here
    console.error(`CRITICAL: Failed to process payment for trip ${trip.id}`, error);
  }
}

// Example: In a service that handles a user cancelling their ride
async function cancelTrip(reservationId, cancellerRole) {
    // ... logic to update reservation status ...

    // Now, handle the complex escrow refund logic
    await carpoolHandler.cancelCarpoolEscrowReturn(reservationId, ...);
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **CRITICAL COMPLEXITY:** This service is extremely complex and mission-critical. **DO NOT MODIFY** without a complete and thorough understanding of the entire carpool lifecycle and escrow flow.
- **LACK OF DB TRANSACTIONS:** The multi-step database operations are not wrapped in transactions, posing a risk of data inconsistency on partial failure. This is a major architectural concern.
- **Testing:** Thorough integration and unit testing for every possible state transition and failure scenario is absolutely essential for a service of this nature.
