# init-services.js Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)

Service initialization module that bootstraps all required services when the TSP API application starts, ensuring proper initialization of timers and background processes.

**Keywords:** service initialization | bootstrap | startup | trip validation | timer management | application lifecycle | service orchestration

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Application startup initialization
- Trip validation timer reinitialization
- Service dependency bootstrapping

**Compatibility:** Node.js 14+, Koa.js framework

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** This service acts like a startup checklist for the application. Just as you might check that all systems are working before launching a rocket, this service ensures all necessary background processes and timers are running before the application accepts requests.

**Technical explanation:** A bootstrapping module that initializes critical services during application startup, currently focused on reinitializing trip validation timers to ensure continuity of scheduled validation processes.

**Business value:** Ensures reliable application startup and prevents service interruptions by properly initializing background processes and scheduled tasks.

**System context:** Called during the TSP API application startup sequence to prepare all necessary services before accepting incoming requests.

## üîß Technical Specifications

- **File:** init-services.js
- **Path:** /src/services/init-services.js
- **Type:** Service module
- **Size:** ~1KB
- **Complexity:** Low

**Dependencies:**
- `@maas/core/log` (required) - Logging functionality
- `@app/src/services/trip` (required) - Trip service for validation timers

**Environment Variables:** None required

**Configuration:** None required

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

**Main Function:**
```javascript
initializeServices() => Promise<void>
```
- Asynchronous initialization of all services
- Currently initializes trip validation timers
- Logs progress and errors
- Gracefully handles initialization failures

**Execution Flow:**
1. Log initialization start
2. Reinitialize trip validation timers
3. Log successful initialization
4. Catch and log any errors without crashing

**Error Handling:**
- Try-catch block prevents application crash on initialization failure
- Detailed error logging with message and stack trace
- Service continues even if some initializations fail

## üöÄ Usage Methods

**Basic Usage:**
```javascript
const { initializeServices } = require('./services/init-services');

// During application startup
await initializeServices();
```

**Adding New Service Initialization:**
```javascript
// In init-services.js
const newService = require('./new-service');

const initializeServices = async () => {
  // Existing initialization
  await tripService.reinitializeValidationTimers();
  
  // Add new service initialization
  await newService.initialize();
};
```

**Integration in App Startup:**
```javascript
// In main application file
app.listen(port, async () => {
  await initializeServices();
  console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## üìä Output Examples

**Successful Initialization:**
```
[initializeServices] Starting services initialization
[initializeServices] Trip validation timers reinitialized
[initializeServices] Services initialization completed
```

**Failed Initialization:**
```
[initializeServices] Starting services initialization
[initializeServices] Error initializing services: Connection timeout
[initializeServices] Stack: Error: Connection timeout
    at TripService.reinitializeValidationTimers...
```

**Monitoring Output:**
- Initialization start timestamp
- Individual service initialization status
- Total initialization time
- Error count and details

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

**Security Considerations:**
- No sensitive data exposed in logs
- Initialization failures logged without exposing credentials

**Common Troubleshooting:**
1. **Initialization hangs:** Check database connectivity
2. **Timer reinitialization fails:** Verify trip service dependencies
3. **Memory issues:** Monitor service initialization memory usage

**Performance Tips:**
- Keep initialization operations lightweight
- Avoid blocking operations during startup
- Use parallel initialization where possible
