# Axios API Wrapper Service Documentation

## üîç Quick Summary (TL;DR)
This service acts as a simple wrapper around the `axios` library for making external `GET` requests. Its primary purpose appears to be centralizing API calls, measuring their duration, and logging metrics, specifically for requests made to the HERE Technologies mapping and routing APIs. It contains two nearly identical methods, `callapi` and `callApiHeaders`, with the only difference being the latter's ability to accept custom headers.

A notable feature is the large, commented-out section for logging metrics to InfluxDB, and a large ASCII art drawing of Buddha at the end of the file, presumably to bless the code with stability.

**Keywords:** axios | api-wrapper | http-client | here-api | routing | monitoring | service-wrapper

**Primary use cases:** 
- Making `GET` requests to external APIs in a centralized way.
- Measuring the time taken for each API call and logging it to the console.
- (Formerly) Pushing detailed performance metrics of HERE API calls to an InfluxDB monitoring service.

**Compatibility:** Node.js >= 16.0.0, Axios.

## ‚ùì Common Questions Quick Index
- **Q: What is this service for?** ‚Üí It's a wrapper for making `axios.get` calls, primarily to the HERE API.
- **Q: What's the difference between `callapi` and `callApiHeaders`?** ‚Üí They are functionally identical, but `callApiHeaders` is intended to accept a `headers` object. However, the way it's passed to `axios.get` might not be correct.
- **Q: What is InfluxDB?** ‚Üí It's a time-series database. The commented-out code shows that this service was once used to send detailed performance metrics (duration, status, errors) about API calls to an InfluxDB instance for monitoring.
- **Q: Why is the `retryDelay` set to such a high number?** ‚Üí `axios.defaults.retryDelay = 1000000;` is not a standard `axios` configuration. `axios` does not have a built-in retry mechanism that uses this parameter. This line likely has no effect and might be a leftover from an attempt to use a library like `axios-retry`.
- **Q: What's with the Buddha ASCII art?** ‚Üí It's a humorous comment often found in code, meant to be a prayer or blessing for the code to run without bugs or crashes ("‰ΩõÁ•ñ‰øù‰Ωë Ê∞∏‰∏çÁï∂Ê©ü Ê∞∏ÁÑ°BUG" translates to "Buddha bless, never crash, never have bugs").

## üìã Functionality Overview

**Non-technical explanation:** 
Think of this service as a **specialized telephone operator for calling other companies' helpdesks (external APIs)**.
- **Making a Call (`callapi`):** You give the operator the phone number (URL) you want to call. The operator places the call, starts a stopwatch, and waits for an answer. When they get a response, they stop the stopwatch, announce how long the call took, and pass the information back to you. If the call fails, they log the error and tell you.
- **Special Monitoring:** This operator has a special interest in calls made to the "HERE" company. For every call to HERE, they used to fill out a detailed performance report and file it in a special cabinet (InfluxDB), noting if the call was successful or not. It seems they've stopped filing these reports but still go through the motions of preparing them.
- **A Plea for Stability:** The operator has a large poster of Buddha on their wall with a prayer for a stable, crash-free telephone system.

**Technical explanation:** 
A class-based wrapper around `axios.get`. It exposes two methods, `callapi` and `callApiHeaders`, which are nearly identical. Both methods take a URL, wrap the `axios.get` call in a `Promise`, and measure the call's duration. They contain specific logic to detect if the URL is a HERE API endpoint. If it is, they prepare a metrics object containing the vendor, service name, status, duration, and error message. The code to actually send this metric to InfluxDB is commented out. The service logs the duration of every call to the console and rejects the promise on any `axios` error.

**Business value explanation:**
Centralizing external API calls into a wrapper service like this is a good practice. It allows for standardized logging, error handling, and performance monitoring. While the monitoring feature is currently disabled, the framework is in place to easily re-enable it. This kind of monitoring is critical for Service Level Agreement (SLA) management with third-party vendors like HERE, allowing the company to track their API's performance, latency, and error rates, which directly impact the application's user experience and reliability.

## üîß Technical Specifications

- **File:** `allrepo/connectsmart/tsp-api/src/services/axiosapi.js`
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES2020)
- **Key Libraries:** `axios`
- **Type:** API Client Wrapper Service
- **File Size:** ~5 KB
- **Complexity Score:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Low-Medium. The code itself is simple, but the duplication and commented-out logic add some complexity.)

## üìù Detailed Code Analysis

### Code Duplication
The methods `callapi` and `callApiHeaders` are almost exact copies of each other. The entire logic block, including the promise structure, the `then` block, the `catch` block, and the special handling for HERE API URLs, is duplicated. This is a significant violation of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. A better design would be to have a single method that accepts an optional `headers` parameter.

### Incorrect `callApiHeaders` Implementation
In the `callApiHeaders` method, the call `axios.get(ApiURLAry, headers)` is likely incorrect based on the `axios` API. The second argument to `axios.get` is the `config` object. To pass only headers, it should be `axios.get(ApiURLAry, { headers: headers })`. The current implementation might work if the `headers` object passed in already has the structure `{ headers: { ... } }`, but it's not robust.

### InfluxDB Monitoring (Commented Out)
The large commented-out blocks show a well-structured monitoring system.
- It correctly identifies the `vendor` ('Here').
- It distinguishes between different `vendorService` types ('Routing' vs. 'Public Transit Routing').
- It logs the `vendorApi` (the base URL), the `meta` (query parameters), the request `status` ('SUCCESS' or 'ERROR'), and the `duration`.
- This is a valuable piece of functionality that has been disabled but could be easily re-enabled.

### The Buddha Comment
The ASCII art at the end is a cultural artifact sometimes seen in codebases from East Asia. It's a lighthearted way for developers to express hope for the stability of the code. It has no functional impact.

## üöÄ Usage Methods

```javascript
const axiosapi = require('@app/src/services/axiosapi');

async function getHereRoute() {
  const hereApiUrl = 'https://router.hereapi.com/v8/routes?origin=...&destination=...&apiKey=...';
  
  try {
    const routeData = await axiosapi.callapi(hereApiUrl);
    // ... process the route data
    return routeData;
  } catch (error) {
    // ... handle the error from the external API
    console.error('Failed to get route from HERE API:', error.message);
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- **Code Refactoring Opportunity**: The entire file could be significantly improved by refactoring the two duplicate methods into a single, more robust method.
- **Ineffective Retry Logic**: The `axios.defaults.retryDelay` setting is non-standard and has no effect. If retries are needed, a library like `axios-retry` should be properly implemented.
- **Disabled Monitoring**: The valuable InfluxDB monitoring is currently commented out. Re-enabling it would provide significant operational insights.
